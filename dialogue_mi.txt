D|                 Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called

D|                 us.

D|                 I don't remember what happened!  We were

D|                 at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having

D|                 fun.

D|                 I don't even know how I got here.

D|                 I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I

D|                 didn't lay a finger on her.

D|                 Kasimov.  Don't flounder.

D|                 Jesus, Come on, come on.  Come

D|                 on, come on! 

D|                 You're the only one who can help me. 

D|                 C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. 

D|                 They'll kill me. 

D|                 You asked for my help.  You asked for my

D|                 help...come on... 

D|                 You're right, of course. 

D|                 The name pal...give us the name. 

D|                 The contact in Minsk..the contact in 

D|                 Minsk..works in a travel agency. 

D|                 Come on! 

D|                 Come on! 

D|                 His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. 

D|                 Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... 

D|                 Got him. 

D|                 Now, we drink. 

D|                 To friends. 

D|                 Yes, Anatoly, yes. 

D|                 Cheers. 

D|                 Get rid of this scum. 

D|                 Did we get it? 

D|                 We got it.  On your feet. 

D|                 I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here. 

D|                 Walk, just walk.  Start walking. 

D|                 I'm walking. 

D|                 Talking's good, walking's better. 

D|                 Sleeping's better. 

D|                 Are you all right Ethan.  What's wrong

D|                 with you? 

D|                 If you're gonna do this again Claire, 

D|                 It's not gonna be on my watch. 

D|                 Oh yeah? 

D|                 Claire. 

D|                 Jack. 

D|                 Just waiting for you, tubs. 

D|                 Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off 

D|                 at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight 

D|                 thousand feet-and we should be arriving 

D|                 in Prague right on schedule. 

D|                 Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? 

D|                 Would you like to watch a movie Mr 

D|                 Phelps? 

D|                 No, I prefer the theatre.  

D|                 Would you consider the cinema of the

D|                 Ukraine? 

D|                 Perhaps you'd choose one for me. 

D|                 Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're 

D|                 about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- 

D|                 -- a former KGB Line X officer now 

D|                 working the international black market 

D|                 selling intelligence.  This morning, we 

D|                 learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half 

D|                 of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- 

D|                 official cover agents working in Eastern 

D|                 Europe. 

D|                 For security reasons, the NOC list is 

D|                 divided into two encoded halves. 

D|                 Golitsyn already has the cryptonym 

D|                 portion, which contains agent code names 

D|                 and targeting areas.  This portion is 

D|                 useless unless combined with the second 

D|                 half -- the true name list that is kept 

D|                 in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. 

D|                 We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the 

D|                 true name list at an Embassy function 

D|                 tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you 

D|                 decide to accept it, is to obtain 

D|                 photographic proof of the theft, apprehend 

D|                 those involved, and return the stolen 

D|                 list.  I don't have to stress the 

D|                 importance of this matter, Jim.  We're 

D|                 keeping it internally black. Because of  

D|                 its urgency, I've already sent to Prague 

D|                 a team selected from your usual group. 

D|                 Ethan Hunt will of course be your point 

D|                 man, as usual.  He's in Kiev; we're 

D|                 getting word to him now. 

D|                 As always, should you or any member of 

D|                 your IM force be caught or killed, the 

D|                 Secretary will disavow all knowledge of 

D|                 your actions.  This tape will self- 

D|                 destruct in five seconds.  Good luck, 

D|                 Jim! 

D|                 Look to your right, then back to me. 

D|                 There's a camera built right into the 

D|                 bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and 

D|                 transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?

D|                 Of course I can hear you. 

D|                 No, in your...ear piece. You have a 

D|                 lovely smile (eyes). Can you hear me 

D|                 now? 

D|                 Loud and clear. 

D|                 What's going on? 

D|                 I don't know. 

D|                 Why don't you take a look? 

D|                 Jack...that's spying. 

D|                 That's what we do isn't it? 

D|                 Jack you're so wicked. 

D|                 Too wicked to have a drink later? 

D|                 I think I might just take that look. 

D|                 Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more 

D|                 than ninety days leave coming. 

D|                 A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. 

D|                 Take it all, if you want.  After this one. 

D|                 I thought I'd take some now. 

D|                 What the hell's made you decide to take 

D|                 your leave at the worst possible time? 

D|                 Claire's in a weird mood too. 

D|                 Oh?  What's the problem? 

D|                 I don't know, I had to go to Chicago 

D|                 again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me. 

D|                 Tell you what? 

D|                 When you started noticing your short term 

D|                 memory loss.  What the problem was you 

D|                 and Claire had in Kiev? 

D|                 What problem? 

D|                 Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking

D|                 burnout here?

D|                 I guess. 

D|                 Ethan, you can't burn out. 

D|                 Why not? 

D|                 Because I can't afford it. And because 

D|                 you'd burn up before you'd burn out. 

D|                 How was Chicago? 

D|                 Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto 

D|                 dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the 

D|                 one about the astronaut who comes back 

D|                 from the first manned flight to Mars 

D|                 after two years?  His wife's got a year 

D|                 old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was 

D|                 it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh,

D|                 it was my friend Sammy."  She says it 

D|                 wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my 

D|                 friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, 

D|                 don't you think I have any friends of my 

D|                 own?!" 

D|                 Boy, you really are grim. Come here, 

D|                 take a look. 

D|                 Beyond Charles Bridge there is our 

D|                 Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if 

D|                 anything goes wrong, this guy will steal 

D|                 the names of our agents in every country 

D|                 all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to 

D|                 the highest bidders -- third world 

D|                 terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- 

D|                 any and everybody who'd love to get rid 

D|                 of long term coverts like us, and some 

D|                 very dear friends among them.  If they're 

D|                 exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over 

D|                 here.  Take a lock at this. 

D|                 I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA 

D|                 and all its shadow organizations have 

D|                 become irrelevant at best and 

D|                 unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we 

D|                 throw a little light on the whole concept 

D|                 of the Pentagon's "black budget."  These 

D|                 covert agency subgroups have confidential 

D|                 funding, they report to no one -- who are

D|                 these people?!  We were living in a 

D|                 democracy the last time I checked. 

D|                 You're going to use Walter? 

D|                 He's our guy. 

D|                 Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? 

D|                 Not this week. This week he's flyfishing 

D|                 at the Oughterard Slough in County 

D|                 Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. 

D|                 He won't be back in a hurry? 

D|                 No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? 

D|                 You think the plot'll work? 

D|                 Sure.  If the main character does. 

D|                 If you were me, Ethan, who would you

D|                 trust to make him believable? 

D|                 Sorry, am I interrupting?  

D|                 Always. 

D|                 Stick of gum. If you come up against a 

D|                 lock you can't pick -- 

D|                 Red light.  Green light.  Mash them 

D|                 together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on 

D|                 you -- you have five seconds. 

D|                 Are you gonna take it? 

D|                 Give me the God damn gum. 

D|                 Just don't chew it. 

D|                 Thank you. 

D|                 Ethan.  Jack's inside.  Window's open by 

D|                 twenty-three hundred. 

D|                 How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, 

D|                 the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just 

D|                 steer you through the reception line here

D|                 --

D|                 Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the 

D|                 director of the National Gallery -- Petr 

D|                 Brandl, the mayor of Prague -- 

D|                 I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator? 

D|                 Of course I do.  How are you, Miss 

D|                 Norman? 

D|                 He's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me. 

D|                 Sarah, mark the package and go to two. 

D|                 Your advance team mentioned you'd want a 

D|                 tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead 

D|                 and set that up for you -- 

D|                 Terrific.  Let's get going. 

D|                 Will you excuse us?  

D|                 Uh, sir? 

D|                 Great.  Come on. 

D|                 Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go. 

D|                 En route. 

D|                 Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to

D|                 night vision). 

D|                 Governor's in position.  We have the elevator. 

D|                 Excuse me, can I help you? 

D|                 -- which leads directly to the Denied 

D|                 Area, the only limited access area in the 

D|                 whole facility. 

D|                 As you can see. this area has both a 

D|                 Marine guard and video surveillance, and 

D|                 is strictly monitored at all times. 

D|                 Senator, don't you have a young man on 

D|                 your staff named JACK? 

D|                 Jack?  I believe we did have a young man 

D|                 named Jack.  Not a reliable man, as I 

D|                 recall.  Constantly late or behind in his 

D|                 work. 

D|                 Excuse me, let me see that ID again! 

D|                 Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a 

D|                 second.  Keep dancing.  

D|                 We were forced to tie him to my best 

D|                 stallion and drag him around the barn a 

D|                 few times.  

D|                 Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on

D|                 it. 

D|                 Oh. Sorry, sir. 

D|                 The drink (date) with Sarah is definitely

D|                 off. 

D|                 Hannah -- I'm blind again.  Hannah. 

D|                 He's heading to the denied area. 

D|                 Higher.  Higher.  

D|                 Higher. 

D|                 Right, right.  Good. 

D|                 Get moving, Ethan.  He's rolling to you. 

D|                 Jack we're in position. 

D|                 Jack.  Jack. 

D|                 I didn't touch it. 

D|                 He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box! 

D|                 OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open

D|                 the doors. 

D|                 What about my coat?  I'll freeze. 

D|                 I don't have it. 

D|                 Opening the doors.  Go under. 

D|                 He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack. 

D|                 Give me a break, Pops. 

D|                 Such a nice ass. 

D|                 And a lonely ass. 

D|                 Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport 

D|                 in five minutes. 

D|                 Roger that. 

D|                 In position.  Jack open the door, let the

D|                 package roll.

D|                 Roger that.  Opening doors now.

D|                 Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to

D|                 transport.

D|                 En route.

D|                 Hey.

D|                 Jack, what are you doing?!

D|                 Iím not doing anything!  (I donít have it

D|                 either).

D|                 I donít have it -- I donít have

D|                 control!

D|                 Uh -- then I have a problem.

D|                 Cut the power.  Cut the power Jack.  Do

D|                 you hear me.

D|                 Come on, Jack, come on.

D|                 Jack.  Jack.

D|                 Man down.  Stay where you are.  Iím on my

D|                 way.

D|                 En route.

D|                 The package is in the open.

D|                 Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.

D|                 Iíve got a shadow.

D|                 Can you lose him?

D|                 No.  Abort.

D|                 Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.                

D|                 Jim we canít.

D|                 Abort.  Thatís an order.

D|                 Negative, Golitsynís on the move.

D|                 No, damn it, no, I said ABORT!

D|                 Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím

D|                 coming to you.

D|                 Jim gave an abort, we should walk

D|                 away.

D|                 No, weíre going to recover the disk,

D|                 understand?!  Now move!

D|                 Where are you?

D|                 About two hundred yards from the bridge.

D|                 Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan.

D|                 Cut all radio communications.  Repeat.

D|                 Cut all radio communications.  

D|                 Satcom seven.

D|                 Central Europe.  Unsecured.

D|                 Go secure.

D|                 Go ahead.

D|                 Theyíre dead.

D|                 Whoís dead?

D|                 My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim -

D|                 - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know

D|                 Are you damaged?

D|                 They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís

D|                 dead too.  The disk is gone.

D|                 Are you intact?

D|                 Do you read me?  The list is in the open!

D|                 Let's just bring you in safely, and then

D|                 we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you

D|                 followed?

D|                 I donít think so.

D|                 Donít think, be sure.  Are you clean?

D|                 Yes.

D|                 Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there

D|                 myself.

D|                 Youíre in Prague?

D|                 Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít

D|                 disappoint me.

D|                 No sir.

D|                 One hour.

D|                 I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know 

D|                 how much Jim in particular meant to you, 

D|                 Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally. 

D|                 Yeah. 

D|                 Passport, visas - you know the drill. 

D|                 We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, 

D|                 debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague 

D|                 police a bone, you know toss them a few 

D|                 suspects.  Follow me? 

D|                 Yeah.  I follow you. 

D|                 We've lost enough agents for one night. 

D|                 You mean I've lost enough agents for one 

D|                 night. 

D|                 You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, 

D|                 Ethan. 

D|                 Who else is left? 

D|                 Yes.  I see your point. 

D|                 Why was there another team? 

D|                 What? 

D|                 Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight. 

D|                 I don't quite follow you. 

D|                 Let's see if you can follow me around 

D|                 this room. 

D|                 The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 

D|                 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing 

D|                 around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. 

D|                 The waiter behind Hannah at the top of 

D|                 the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The 

D|                 other IMF team.  You're worried about me. 

D|                 Why?

D|                 You're right.  Maybe this'll save some 

D|                 time. 

D|                 For a little over two years now we've 

D|                 been spotting serious blowback in IMF 

D|                 operations.  We have a penetration.  The 

D|                 other day we decoded a message on the 

D|                 Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."

D|                 The arms dealer. 

D|                 That's right.  Max, it seems, has two 

D|                 unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity

D|                 and for corrupting susceptible agents. 

D|                 This time he's gotten to someone on the 

D|                 inside - he's put himself in a position 

D|                 to buy our NOC list. An operation he 

D|                 referred to as "Job 314".  The job he 

D|                 thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. 

D|                 But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. 

D|                 Correct the actual list is safe at 

D|                 Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, 

D|                 one of ours. 

D|                 This whole operation was a molehunt. 

D|                 Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like 

D|                 you said.  You survived. 

D|                 I want to show you something, Ethan. 

D|                 Since your father's death, your family's 

D|                 farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, 

D|                 suddenly, they're flush with over a 

D|                 hundred and twenty grand in the bank. 

D|                 Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped 

D|                 out the bank account -- dying slowly in 

D|                 America after all, can be a very 

D|                 expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why 

D|                 don't we go quietly out of here onto the 

D|                 plane... 

D|                 How about if we just go quietly into the 

D|                 bathroom and I wash your mouth out with 

D|                 soap - you pathetic button down 

D|                 bureaucratic asshole. 

D|                 Ethan, I can understand you're very 

D|                 upset. 

D|                 Kitteridge, you've never seen me very 

D|                 upset. 

D|                 All right, enough is  enough Hunt. You've 

D|                 bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on 

D|                 intimate loyalties to get away with it. 

D|                 You're determined to shake hands with the 

D|                 devil and I'm going to make sure you do 

D|                 it in hell.

D|                 I needed you, Ethan. 1 needed you on the 

D|                 bridge, and -- you weren't there.  Ethan? 

D|                 Ethan? 

D|                 What are you doing here?! 

D|                 Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. 

D|                 Ethan what's wrong with you? 

D|                 Don't move. 

D|                 You were in the car! 

D|                 I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in 

D|                 trouble on the radio.  He said someone 

D|                 was... 

D|                 Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the 

D|                 car. 

D|                 No, I got out of the car and I ran to the

D|                 bridge. 

D|                 Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge. 

D|                 What happened to Jim? 

D|                 There was nobody on the bridge. 

D|                 What happened to Jim? 

D|                 Dead.  Dead.  Dead!  Wake up, Claire! 

D|                 Jim's dead, they're dead.  They're all 

D|                 dead! 

D|                 They're dead.  Jim's dead. 

D|                 Take off your coat. 

D|                 What? 

D|                 Take off your God damn coat! 

D|                 Where were you? 

D|                 I walked away.  He said abort.  He was 

D|                 gone so I walked away. 

D|                 That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? 

D|                 Did they send you here? 

D|                 Who is "they?" 

D|                 Did they send you...Did they send you? 

D|                 Who is they, who is they? 

D|                 Who sent you?!  Who sent you? 

D|                 No one sent me!  We're supposed to be 

D|                 back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, 

D|                 if we abort, we don't return here until 

D|                 four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, 

D|                 four o'clock --! 

D|                 Why haven't they brought us in yet? 

D|                 I've been disavowed.  They think I killed 

D|                 Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred 

D|                 thousand dollars found its way into my 

D|                 parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes 

D|                 I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've 

D|                 been in the employ of an arms dealer, 

D|                 Max, for the last two years, to get him 

D|                 our NOC list. 

D|                 What are you going to do? 

D|                 I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the 

D|                 mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, 

D|                 at least part of the time. 1 can't find 

D|                 him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, 

D|                 he'll find me. 

D|                 

D|                 Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me 

D|                 go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going 

D|                 to tell him you had nothing to do... 

D|                 Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not 

D|                 dead, he's going to assume you're with 

D|                 me. 

D|                 The message is for Job. 

D|                 I'm going to answer it. 

D|                 Excuse me, could I trouble you for a 

D|                 match? 

D|                 Would you remove your hat please? 

D|                 Why? 

D|                 You wish to meet Max?  This is the price 

D|                 of admission. 

D|                 I thought I was going to see Max. 

D|                 You misunderstood.  No one sees Max. 

D|                 Then what am I doing here? 

D|                 Allowing Max to see you and hear what 

D|                 you've got to say. 

D|                 I don't communicate very well through a 

D|                 shroud. 

D|                 If Max doesn't like what you have to say, 

D|                 you'll be wearing that shroud 

D|                 indefinitely. 

D|                 I'm willing to take the chance. 

D|                 Very well. 

D|                 Who are you and what are you doing here? 

D|                 I need one hundred thousand dollars. 

D|                 Really?  And you thought if you simply 

D|                 showed up I might give it to you? 

D|                 Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and 

D|                 twenty five thousand. 

D|                 The penny drops.  You are not Job.  Yes, 

D|                 Job is not given to quoting Scripture in 

D|                 his communications. And there was its 

D|                 tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is 

D|                 not playful.  So you're something of a 

D|                 paradox. 

D|                 That depends. 

D|                 On what? 

D|                 Whether you like a paradox.  I want a 

D|                 hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 

D|                 It's quite out of the question. 

D|                 The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's 

D|                 bait, part of an internal molehunt. 

D|                 And how might you know that?  Are you 

D|                 another Company man? 

D|                 Like Job? 

D|                 Ah, but, we're asking about you. 

D|                 I'm NOC.  Was.  Now disavowed. 

D|                 Why, may I ask? 

D|                 That's the question I want to ask Job. 

D|                 I don't know Job any more than he knows 

D|                 me. 

D|                 Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an 

D|                 introduction. 

D|                 Why should I? 

D|                 Because I can deliver the actual NOC 

D|                 list.  The one you have is not only 

D|                 worthless, it's certain to be equipped 

D|                 with a homing device to pinpoint your 

D|                 exact location. 

D|                 It's easy to say the disk is worthless 

D|                 when you say I can't look at the 

D|                 information and see if it's worthless. 

D|                 Not a tenable position, sir. 

D|                 Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from 

D|                 thirty seconds to ten minutes you're 

D|                 gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping 

D|                 around you like jackrabbits. 

D|                 Mm - Hmmm... 

D|                 Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner 

D|                 you used in the car? 

D|                 Very good. 

D|                 Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up 

D|                 first. 

D|                 Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so 

D|                 good. 

D|                 That's not so good for you, my friend. 

D|                 Thirty-two and change. 

D|                 Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just 

D|                 be the hard drive heating up. 

D|                 Forty-four.  Forty-five. 

D|                 I'd say you've got about two minutes. 

D|                 Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine. 

D|                 Switch it on.  Keep cleaning. 

D|                 Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use 

D|                 one of his apartments again. 

D|                 Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy. 

D|                 You're a good sport.  Do accept the 

D|                 compliment. 

D|                 Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine? 

D|                 I don't have to tell you what a comfort 

D|                 anonymity can be in my profession -- like 

D|                 a warm blanket. 

D|                 My deal with Job was subject to a 

D|                 successful boot scan.  Obviously it 

D|                 didn't pass muster.  Deal's off. 

D|                 What was your deal with Job? 

D|                 Six million dollars.  I'll give you the 

D|                 same.  But I want the complete list now, 

D|                 not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this 

D|                 piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want 

D|                 the entire list, the true name of every 

D|                 non-official cover agent throughout the 

D|                 world. 

D|                 Ten million.  Ten million in negotiable 

D|                 U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer 

D|                 form, coupons attached.  And one more 

D|                 thing -- your personal assurance that Job 

D|                 will be at the exchange. 

D|                 Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want 

D|                 it by the end of the week. 

D|                 How will you make sure Job will be there? 

D|                 How will you make sure I'll have the list 

D|                 in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now 

D|                 where can I drop you dear boy? 

D|                 I'm not being dropped anywhere without my 

D|                 money. 

D|                 I'm going to have to front you 

D|                 personally.  Don't lose that money 

D|                 without losing your life. 

D|                 I wouldn't dream of it. 

D|                 The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under 

D|                 until he decides to surface. 

D|                 Look we can use someone from the Embassy 

D|                 and we can get the local authorities 

D|                 involved. Close off his transportation. 

D|                 What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the 

D|                 airport?  How many identities do you 

D|                 think Hunt has?  How many times has he 

D|                 slipped past custom, in how many 

D|                 countries?  These guys are trained to be 

D|                 ghosts.  We taught them how to do it, for 

D|                 Christ's sake! 

D|                 So what do you suggest? 

D|                 Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make 

D|                 him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure 

D|                 points.  Find out something that's 

D|                 important to him personally and you 

D|                 squeeze. 

D|                 Max made a deal with you? 

D|                 I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job. 

D|                 We've got seventy-five rounds for your 

D|                 Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig 

D|                 Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with 

D|                 monitor, plenty of passports. You said 

D|                 it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with 

D|                 you. 

D|                 You're sure about this? 

D|                 Jim was my husband. I want to know who 

D|                 killed him. ( ALT ) I want to get the son 

D|                 of a bitch who did this. 

D|                 We need help, and we don't have time. 

D|                 They have to be local. 

D|                 What kind of help? 

D|                 Simple game.  Four players. 

D|                 Exfil opens the pocket -- 

D|                 -- cyber ops lifts the wallet. 

D|                 Bank? 

D|                 IMF mainframe. 

D|                 Where exactly is it? 

D|                 In Langley. 

D|                 In Langley?  The one in Virginia, Langley? 

D|                 Inside CIA headquarters at Langley. 

D|                 Is he serious? 

D|                 Always. 

D|                 If we're going to Virginia, why don't we 

D|                 drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a 

D|                 helicopter right in through the lobby and  

D|                 set it down inside the vault and it will 

D|                 be a hell of a lot easier than breaking 

D|                 into the God damn CIA. 

D|                 What are we downloading? 

D|                 Information. 

D|                 What kind? 

D|                 Profitable. 

D|                 Payment on delivery. 

D|                 I don't know.  This I don't know. 

D|                 This doesn't sound like the Luther 

D|                 Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used 

D|                 to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas 

D|                 Phreak?  The only man alive who actually 

D|                 hacked NATO Ghostcom. 

D|                 There was never any physical evidence 

D|                 that I had anything to do with that.. 

D|                 that.. 

D|                 With that exceptional piece of work. 

D|                 You don't know what you're missing. This 

D|                 is the Mt. Everest of hacks. 

D|                 You're all kidding yourselves. Even with 

D|                 top of the line crypto.  Cray access. 

D|                 STU 3's -- 

D|                 Krieger can get it. 

D|                 Right? 

D|                 May take a little time. 

D|                 May take a little time. That's not what 

D|                 Claire tells me about you. 

D|                 Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking 

D|                 about the 686 prototypes -- with the 

D|                 artificial intelligence Risk chip -- 

D|                 Twenty-four hours. 

D|                 And I get to keep the equipment when 

D|                 we're done. 

D|                 Luther, I guess you're all out of 

D|                 excuses.

D|                 I can't just hack my way inside.  There's 

D|                 no modem access to the mainframe, it's in 

D|                 a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically 

D|                 at the terminal. 

D|                 Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. 

D|                 The terminal's in black vault lock-down. 

D|                 They missed nothing in that room.  Even 

D|                 the vents have laser nets over them.  

D|                 Inside, there are three countermeasure 

D|                 systems that can only be deactivated by 

D|                 authorized entry.  Which we won't have. 

D|                 The first system is sound-sensitive, 

D|                 anything above a whisper sets it off. 

D|                 The second system is on the floor and 

D|                 pressure-sensitive --

D|                 --and the third detects any increase in 

D|                 temperature.  Even the body heat of an 

D|                 unauthorized person in the room will 

D|                 trigger it. 

D|                 All three systems are state of the art. 

D|                 

D|                 And you really think we can do this. 

D|                 May I come in? 

D|                 Sure... 

D|                 It's cash. And a second passport. If 

D|                 anything goes wrong when we're inside, if 

D|                 you sense even the slightest deviation 

D|                 don't look over your shoulder, you walk 

D|                 away - you hear me? Just walk away. 

D|                 You don't think we're going to make it. 

D|                 I didn't say that. 

D|                 You didn't have to......... 

D|                 I just need you to be safe. 

D|                 What about you? 

D|                 What about me - Jim called an abort - I 

D|                 didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just 

D|                 need you to be safe. 

D|                 I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.. 

D|                 Sorry. 

D|                 What I want to know is how Hunt accessed 

D|                 the disavowed file, even after we cut off 

D|                 his authorization code. 

D|                 He may have used Phelps' code. They were 

D|                 friends, and Phelps, was still valid for 

D|                 twenty-four hours.  

D|                 If that's the case, we need to implement 

D|                 a system to immediately deactivate an 

D|                 agent's code immediately... 

D|                 I can't believe what I'm listening to. 

D|                 Hunt just kicked us in the ass, you guys 

D|                 are standing here trying to figure out 

D|                 what kind of shoes he had on!  I don't

D|                 care how he did it, I want to know why he 

D|                 did it!  Is he recruiting?  For what 

D|                 purpose? 

D|                 Survival. 

D|                 Too short sighted.  This guy's proactive,

D|                 he initiates.  The question is what does 

D|                 he want now and where does he need to get 

D|                 it and Barnes what the hell is that

D|                 noise?! 

D|                 Fire alarm, Gene. 

D|                 Oh, for -- do we have to evacuate? 

D|                 That's S.O.P.. 

D|                 We picked up alarms in sectors three, 

D|                 seven, and twelve. 

D|                 Yeah.  That's what I've got too. 

D|                 What sector's the air conditioning? 

D|                 Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in 

D|                 sector twenty-one. 

D|                 I gotta go in there and shut it down! 

D|                 Nobody goes into any sector where the 

D|                 alarm didn't go off. 

D|                 Do you want to blow the fire through the 

D|                 whole building? 

D|                 Nobody goes into any sector where the 

D|                 alarm did not go off --

D|                 --and it did not go off in twenty-one! 

D|                 Twenty-one, twenty-one --

D|                 Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go. 

D|                 Let's move! 

D|                 Hi there. 

D|                 Air conditioning's through here! 

D|                 William Donloe. 

D|                 Where's the other guy? 

D|                 Zero body count. 

D|                 We'll see.  

D|                 Time up. 

D|                 1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast.  Luther, I'm 

D|                 going in.  Don't disappoint me...Krieger, 

D|                 from here on in, absolute silence. 

D|                 Oh, God. 

D|                 Type this password: AW96B6.  Return.  Go 

D|                 to the files menu, find the NOC list 

D|                 file.  Open "NOC List."  Put your 

D|                 diskette in.  Double click on the NOC 

D|                 list. 

D|                 Ok, good!  It's scrolling.  0K, now we're 

D|                 going to download.  Edit menu.  Select 

D|                 "copy to disc".  You're downloading. 

D|                 When it's all green it's done. 

D|                 Holy mother of God. 

D|                 You've done it.  Eject it. 

D|                 He's rolling.  Get moving! 

D|                 Get out of there -- get out of there --

D|                 He's at the vault - get moving!  1 

D|                 yellow, 2 yellows...Toast! 

D|                 You're not moving!

D|                 Phew! (to himself) NOC list. 

D|                 Merci. 

D|                 We're not outta here yet. 

D|                 Think, for Christ's sake, you guys are 

D|                 mired in detail, open your minds, it's 

D|                 gotta be staring us in the face!  What 

D|                 does Ethan Hunt want?! 

D|                 Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same 

D|                 thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list! 

D|                 Okay! 

D|                 And where is the list vulnerable? 

D|                 Other than here. 

D|                 It's for you. 

D|                 Kittridge, yup? 

D|                 You and I know about this -- and that's 

D|                 where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened. 

D|                 What about him...? 

D|                 I want him manning a radar tower in 

D|                 Alaska by the end of the day.  Just mail 

D|                 him his clothes. 

D|                 You contacting your buyer? 

D|                 Ethan? 

D|                 Ethan?  Oh, 'scuse me Mr. Hunt? 

D|                 MAX -- Now might be an excellent time 

D|                 to interpret Scripture face to face. 

D|                 Meet on TGV, noon tomorrow.  Take 

D|                 seat 27.  Bring our mutual friend 

D|                 Job.

D|                 You're not going to any meeting without me. 

D|                 My contact is extremely shy. 

D|                 I don't think you're in any position to 

D|                 give orders, do you?  Not while I'm 

D|                 holding this. 

D|                 Krieger. 

D|                 Stay out of this. 

D|                 Lachez - moi 

D|                 T'agueue 

D|                 Don't you mean this? 

D|                 That's not it.  That's not the list. 

D|                 What's the matter, you don't know this 

D|                 trick? 

D|                 Where did it go?!  It's GONE! 

D|                 But not too far! 

D|                 I know what you're thinking, Krieger. 

D|                 You're thinking, back in the computer 

D|                 room -- I was up here -- he was down 

D|                 there -- .  He was carrying two discs. 

D|                 So hard to keep track of these things. 

D|                 Where is it? 

D|                 I thought you had it!  Do you actually 

D|                 think I'd let you have the NOC list? 

D|                 Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and 

D|                 Iíll cut your throat. 

D|                 I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've 

D|                 never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan. 

D|                 We did what we had to do. 

D|                 I'm going to try and get some sleep. 

D|                 Krieger did have the NOC list. 

D|                 Now I want you to hold onto it. 

D|                 What makes you trust me? 

D|                 Because if you knew what you were getting 

D|                 into, you never would have done it. 

D|                 I'm not letting this list get out in the 

D|                 open. 

D|                 Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on 

D|                 the train, you can't let this list get 

D|                 out into the open.  What's the range of 

D|                 this thing? 

D|                 It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be 

D|                 close. 

D|                 I'll get you close. 

D|                 Ethan I need to talk to you. 

D|                 The unlikely setting...a farm in the 

D|                 heartland of America...the State of 

D|                 Wisconsin, where federal agents claim to 

D|                 have broken the brain trust behind an 

D|                 international drug ring.  For a report we 

D|                 go live now to CNN correspondent (Joe 

D|                 Jones) in the state capitol, Madison. 

D|                 Authorities have identified the couple as 

D|                 Margaret Ethan Hunt and Donald Hunt. 

D|                 Here they are now. 

D|                 They were apprehended this morning by the 

D|                 DEA in a major sting operation for the 

D|                 illegal manufacture of the drug 

D|                 methcathinone, known on the street as 

D|                 "cat". 

D|                 Similar to methamphetamines, cat is seen 

D|                 by officials as one of the most powerful 

D|                 and dangerous drugs in the world.  Some 

D|                 thirty-four cat labs have been seized so 

D|                 far, but the recently widowed Mrs. Hunt 

D|                 and her brother-in-law are believed to be 

D|                 involved in a global drug distribution 

D|                 network. 

D|                 Mr. Fairchild, agent Fairchild, a comment 

D|                 please. 

D|                 I think it's sad, really.  Farmers, 

D|                 unless they're a conglomerate, are always 

D|                 operating on a paper-thin margin.  I'm 

D|                 afraid what we have here is a case of a 

D|                 naive and lonely widow with a lot of 

D|                 financial problems who chose to make 

D|                 money through illegal means. 

D|                 That was John Fairchild, the DEA agent in 

D|                 charge of this investigation.  Officials 

D|                 tell me that international law 

D|                 enforcement agents are expected to arrive 

D|                 here later today to question the Hunts. 

D|                 This is Joe Jones, CNN, Love in Madison, 

D|                 Wisconsin. 

D|                 Kittridge... 

D|                 Bastard! 

D|                 Don't...don't touch me... 

D|                 What are you going to do? 

D|                 He's expecting my call. 

D|                 I'm going to the station... 

D|                 And I'm going to call him. 

D|                 Kittridge. 

D|                 I see you've been out visiting the folks. 

D|                 It's Hunt.  What do you need for a 

D|                 pinpoint? 

D|                 Been watching a little T.V., have you? 

D|                 Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was 

D|                 an especially nice touch. 

D|                 He's in England. 

D|                 Get MI5. 

D|                 Ethan, I want to reassure you that my 

D|                 first order of business after you come in 

D|                 is to get these ridiculous charges 

D|                 against your family dropped and 

D|                 eliminated completely from their files. 

D|                 Come in now, we can plea down the charges 

D|                 against you as well. 

D|                 Can I ask you something, Kittridge? 

D|                 

D|                 Certainly Ethan. 

D|                 If you're dealing with someone who's 

D|                 crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five 

D|                 members of his own IMF team, how 

D|                 devastated do you think you're going to 

D|                 make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald 

D|                 down to the county courthouse? 

D|                 I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me? 

D|                 Lost him.  We needed three more seconds. 

D|                 He wanted us to know he was in London. 

D|                 You're a hard man to catch up with. 

D|                 

D|                 ..the next day I managed to drag myself 

D|                 to the safe house, must've just missed 

D|                 you..anyway, I checked our aliases.

D|                 - and picked us up in the States -

D|                 - but you left before I could get there 

D|                 and I could check just so many places.. 

D|                 Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize 

D|                 customs records - 

D|                 - so I watched Europe. Once you showed 

D|                 up in England..it was easy. 

D|                 You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool 

D|                 Street. 

D|                 Hey, I showed 'em to you! 

D|                 I remember.. 

D|                 Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A 

D|                 doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't 

D|                 sit up straight. 

D|                 I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit 

D|                 up straight very well.  It's not 

D|                 important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I 

D|                 saw the mole.  It was Kittridge. 

D|                 Kittridge! 

D|                 Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the 

D|                 mole? 

D|                 Yeah. 

D|                 How did Kittridge do it?.. 

D|                 - first he took care of Jack in the 

D|                 elevator - 

D|                 - he shot you on the bridge - 

D|                 - he must have had back up take out 

D|                 Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.. 

D|                 How did he do Hannah? 

D|                 No.  No.  He could've taken out Hannah 

D|                 himself. 

D|                 Why, Jim?  Why?

D|                 ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was

D|                 inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more

D|                 secrets you keep from everyone but

D|                 yourself, operations you answer to no one

D|                 but yourself.  Then one morning you wake

D|                 up and find out the President of the

D|                 United States is running the country -

D|                 without your permission.  The son-of-a-

D|                 bitch!  How dare he?  You realize itís

D|                 over, youíre an obsolete piece of

D|                 hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got

D|                 a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a 

D|                 year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no

D|                 good son-of-a-bitch, big time!

D|                 We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after

D|                 us.

D|                 Whatís going to make him do that?

D|                 What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC

D|                 list.

D|                 Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.

D|                 A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to

D|                 Paris.

D|                 Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.

D|                 If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to

D|                 Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.

D|                 Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with

D|                 me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will

D|                 have helicopter transport waiting in

D|                 Paris.

D|                 Jim...?

D|                 I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you

D|                 and suddenly there she was, standing in

D|                 the rain just outside the safe

D|                 house..alive and beautiful..and thinking

D|                 Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís

D|                 had to do forget about me to keep going

D|                 and get the job done, I..

D|                 - no.  She canít know about me.  No one

D|                 can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too

D|                 much at stake, Ethan.

D|                 Youíre probably right.

D|                 I usually am.

D|                 Once we leave the safehouse, get in there

D|                 and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.

D|                 You got it.

D|                 And get a doctor.

D|                 Good luck.

D|                 What happened?

D|                 I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for

D|                 tomorrow.

D|                 Okay...

D|                 Is this the only way?

D|                 Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...

D|                 How long to the London Terminus?

D|                 Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

D|                 Youíve got ten.  Move!

D|                 How long until we reach the Chunnel?

D|                 Twenty minutes.

D|                 Yes...

D|                 Itís him.

D|                 This wasnít what we discussed.

D|                 My apologies Max.  Couldnít be helped.

D|                 Thereís a piece of black cloth under your

D|                 seat.  Tear it away and youíll find the

D|                 disk.

D|                 Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít

D|                 prelude a meeting in private.

D|                 It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you

D|                 tell me where the money is.

D|                 The possibility alone is worth ten

D|                 million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver

D|                 briefcase.  Combination 314.

D|                 What about Job?

D|                 I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve

D|                 got the money -- heíll find you.

D|                 Only four more cars.

D|                 And if we donít find him - weíll search

D|                 the whole train again.

D|                 Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?

D|                 High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No-

D|                 one gets off.  High security.  Good place

D|                 for a pass off to Max.

D|                 But why tell us?

D|                 Heís putting on a show, Barnes.

D|                 What kind of show.

D|                 I donít know.

D|                 It didnít say on the tickets.

D|                 Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.

D|                 Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How

D|                 far is he from Luther?

D|                 Two cars.  Where are you?

D|                 You are my eyes.  Stay with him.

D|                 Heís in the baggage car.

D|                      compartment)

D|                 Iíll be there.

D|                 Whatís the problem.

D|                 Connection denied.

D|                 Try it again.

D|                 Itís not working.

D|                 Is something wrong with the phone?

D|                 Well is something wrong with the

D|                 batteries?

D|                 I always check the batteries.

D|                 Run it through from the top.

D|                 Nothing but civilians, Gene.

D|                 This is bullshit - we donít even know

D|                 what Max looks like.

D|                 Maybe we donít have to know what he looks

D|                 like.  If heís got that list, heís going

D|                 to want to check it.  We should be

D|                 looking for laptops.

D|                 Good idea.

D|                 Excuse me, Sir, your telephone...

D|                 Itís working.

D|                 Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...

D|                 Iíve got the money.  Meet me in the

D|                 baggage car.

D|                 Get this door open.

D|                 Hello, Luther.  Whereís Hunt?

D|                 Mr. Kittridge, the NOC list is being

D|                 modemed off the train.

D|                 Where?

D|                 Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me

D|                 Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him?

D|                 We take the money.  Ethan takes the

D|                 blame.  No-one else has seen you alive.

D|                 No-one will believe him.

D|                 Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say

D|                 that Claire.

D|                 Ethan?

D|                 Yes.  Ethan Hunt, darling.  Remember him?

D|                 You knew about Jim?

D|                 Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew

D|                 is something of a question.  Before or

D|                 after I showed in London, mind telling

D|                 me, Ethan?

D|                 Before London.  But after you took the

D|                 Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

D|                 They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn

D|                 Gideons.

D|                 Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll

D|                 have to be quicker than Iíd like.

D|                 Certainly quicker than youíd like.

D|                 Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..

D|                 Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk?

D|                 Well, Claire, youíve asked the question

D|                 and you are the answer.

D|                 I knew about Jim.

D|                 But, he didnít know about you.  In all

D|                 fairness, Ethan, Claire was never

D|                 convinced her charms would work with you.

D|                 But I was supremely confident - having

D|                 tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet

D|                 thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan

D|                 is in love with you, Claire, make no

D|                 mistake about it.  And like all the 

D|                 worldís lovers, heís tortured by the

D|                 same, one pathetic question - "does she

D|                 feel the same way I do?"

D|                 Well Claire do you?  Have you been

D|                 exploiting his feelings or returning

D|                 them?

D|                 Jim - lets just get the money and get out

D|                 of here.

D|                 The money Ethan.

D|                 Youíve earned it.

D|                 Count it.

D|                 Tell me something Claire, that night in

D|                 Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up

D|                 the car and scattered Hannah all over

D|                 town?

D|                 Keep counting Claire.

D|                 It was me.  I did it.

D|                 Satisfied?

D|                 All ten million.

D|                 Fold it.  Fold it tight.

D|                 Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten

D|                 million is better than six.

D|                 Donít flatter yourself - six was for

D|                 Eastern Europe.  You made a lousy deal -

D|                 ten for the world?  What is that?  But I

D|                 needed you for the transfer with Max.  I

D|                 got a little extra change;  and you got a

D|                 little extra too.

D|                 Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.

D|                 Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not

D|                 the only one whoís seen you alive.

D|                 Good morning, Mr Phelps.

D|                 You son of a bitch.

D|                 Donít Jim.

D|                 Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You

D|                 like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?

D|                 Yes.

D|                 Jim, itís over.

D|                 Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing

D|                 can be more dangerous than the truth.  It

D|                 can kill you.

D|                 Claire...Hey...

D|                 This stuff is so sticky.

D|                 Claire.

D|                 Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me

D|                 back...wonít you...

D|                 I always have, Claire.. 

D|                 Damn!

D|                 No, no, it's IN the tunnel! 

D|                 Stop the train! 

D|                 It'll crash into us!  Accelerate, 

D|                 accelerate. 

D|                 Red light, green light.  Asta Lasagna 

D|                 mother fucker. 

D|                 I think this is what you're looking for. 

D|                 My lawyers will have a field day with 

D|                 this.  Entrapment, jurisdictional 

D|                 conflicts -- 

D|                 Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of 

D|                 this one. 

D|                 I'm sure we can find something I have 

D|                 that you need. 

D|                 You know, I would love to try. 

D|                 Reach your folks? 

D|                 How they feeling? 

D|                 About what? 

D|                 The official apology from the Justice 

D|                 Department, the VIP treatment, you know, 

D|                 the whole nine yards. 

D|                 Well my Mother was a little confused 

D|                 about how the DEA could mistake her and 

D|                 Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers 

D|                 in the Florida keys. 

D|                 Cheers. 

D|                 Here's to  you, Luther. (clink glasses)  To 

D|                 being off the disavowed list. 

D|                 Hey, I'm the flavour of the month! 

D|                 You're more than that, Luther.  They were 

D|                 mistaken about you and they're trying to 

D|                 show you they know it.  They want you 

D|                 back in. 

D|                 Sure.  They want me back in so I won't 

D|                 break in!  They still can't figure out 

D|                 how we did it. 

D|                 You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing? 

D|                 I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back 

D|                 pay, give me a promotion, check out my 

D|                 office at Langley and then, maybe, talk 

D|                 about it. 

D|                 It's all one big negotiation, isn't it? 

D|                 Why don't you come back with me? 

D|                 Just don't know why I'd be doing it. 

D|                 You really liked Phelps, didn't you? 

D|                 He was a good guy for a long, long time. 

D|                 Just - not long enough. (looks up) Gotta 

D|                 catch my flight..(rising) 

D|                 So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen 

D|                 again? 

D|                 Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss 

D|                 being disreputable. 

D|                 Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any 

D|                 better I'll always think of you that way. 

D|                 Would you like to watch a movie, Miss 

D|                 Clarke? 

D|                 Excuse me, Mr. Hunt.  Would you like to

D|                 watch a movie.

D|                 No, thank you.

D|                 Would you consider the cinema of the 

D|                 Caribbean? 

D|                 Aruba, perhaps? 

None
