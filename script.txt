S|      INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT

 | 

N|      We're in a large closet.  JACK KIEFER, an athletic American

N|      in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a

N|      corner, staring at a television screen.

 | 

N|      The television shows a surveillance view of the living room

N|      that lies outside the confines of the closet.  The TV image

N|      is in black and white.  JACK shifts, trying like hell to get

N|      comfortable but he's been there a while

 | 

S|      ON THE SCREEN

 | 

N|      A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel

N|      room.  Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits

N|      in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T-

N|      shirt.  There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the

N|      room behind him.  A legend:

 | 

C|                           KIEV

 | 

N|      KASIMOV is sobbing.  Uncontrollably.  A MAN enters the room,

N|      ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian

N|      godfather.  The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out.  ANATOLY

N|      looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit

N|      by him in a chair he picks up for him.  KASIMOV does as he is

N|      bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY.  They speak in Russian

N|      which is subtitled.

 | 

C|                           ANATOLY

D|                 Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called

D|                 us.

 | 

C|                           KASIMOV

M|                      (sobbing)

D|                 I don't remember what happened!  We were

D|                 at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having

D|                 fun.

 | 

N|      ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the

N|      room.  A WOMAN lies half under the sheets.  She's lying in an

N|      unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared

N|      with blood.  She's dead.  ANATOLY lifts her eyelid.

 | 

C|                           KASIMOV

D|                 I don't even know how I got here.

D|                 I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I

D|                 didn't lay a finger on her.

 | 

N|      ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN.

 | 

C|                           ANATOLY

D|                 Kasimov.  Don't flounder.

 | 

S|      IN THE CLOSET

 | 

N|      JACK, impatient, checks his watch. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Jesus, Come on, come on.  Come

D|                 on, come on! 

 | 

S|      ON THE SCREEN 

 | 

C|                           KASIMOV 

D|                 You're the only one who can help me. 

 | 

N|      Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket.  But ANATOLY hits 

N|      his hand away and smacks him around the head. 

 | 

S|      IN THE CLOSET 

 | 

N|      JACK reacts. 

 | 

S|      ON THE SCREEN

 | 

N|      ANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV. 

 | 

C|                           ANATOLY 

D|                 C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. 

 | 

C|                           KASIMOV 

D|                 They'll kill me. 

 | 

N|      ANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV. 

 | 

C|                           ANATOLY 

D|                 You asked for my help.  You asked for my

D|                 help...come on... 

 | 

C|                           KASIMOV

D|                 You're right, of course. 

 | 

S|      IN THE CLOSET 

 | 

N|      JACK leans forward. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 The name pal...give us the name. 

 | 

S|      ON THE SCREEN 

 | 

C|                           KASIMOV 

D|                 The contact in Minsk..the contact in 

D|                 Minsk..works in a travel agency. 

 | 

S|      IN THE CLOSET 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Come on! 

 | 

S|      ON THE SCREEN 

 | 

C|                           ANATOLY 

D|                 Come on! 

 | 

C|                           KASIMOV 

D|                 His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. 

 | 

C|                           ANATOLY 

D|                 Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... 

 | 

S|      IN THE CLOSET 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Got him. 

 | 

S|      ON THE SCREEN 

 | 

N|      Back on screen, ANATOLY places a hand on KASIMOV'S shoulder

N|      as if he had just anointed him. 

 | 

S|      IN THE CLOSET 

 | 

N|      In the closet, JACK types the name into a computer and cross 

N|      checks -- "MIEDIEV" comes up, then "posting/American 

N|      consulate/Kiev." 

 | 

N|      JACK turns and nods to a WHOREHOUSE WAITRESS in costume in 

N|      the closet next to him, dressed in traditional Russian tunic 

N|      and virtually no bottom.  She quickly leaves. 

 | 

S|      INT. SHABBY ROOM - NIGHT

 | 

N|      We enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does. 

N|      She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot 

N|      glasses. 

 | 

C|                           ANATOLY 

D|                 Now, we drink. 

 | 

N|      He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV. 

 | 

C|                           ANATOLY (CONT'D) 

D|                 To friends. 

 | 

C|                           KASIMOV 

D|                 Yes, Anatoly, yes. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Cheers. 

 | 

N|      He drinks.  He blinks.  Something felt funny about that. 

N|      Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY 

N|      moves to the closet door and opens it. 

 | 

S|      IN THE CLOSET 

 | 

N|      ANATOLY reaches up to his face --

 | 

N|      --and tears away a mask of flesh.  He's no middle aged 

N|      Russian mobster, he's ETHAN HUNT, an American in his early 

N|      thirties.  He gestures to KASIMOV contemptuously.  JACK hands 

N|      ETHAN a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the 

N|      room. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

M|                      (in English now) 

D|                 Get rid of this scum. 

 | 

N|      Immediately, there is activity, and PEOPLE everywhere.  TWO 

N|      OTHERS come into the room and carry KASIMOV out. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks 

N|      the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He 

N|      strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the 

N|      dead woman's thigh.  He checks her pulse again, checking a 

N|      stopwatch.  In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open. 

 | 

N|      CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half 

N|      rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her 

N|      mouth. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 Did we get it? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 We got it.  On your feet. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Walk, just walk.  Start walking. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 I'm walking. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Talking's good, walking's better. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 Sleeping's better. 

 | 

N|      Meanwhile, MEN in overalls take apart the room.  The ceiling 

N|      lifts right off the walls, and the walls themselves start to 

N|      come down, revealing the "hotel room" to be an elaborate set 

N|      in the middle of an empty warehouse. 

 | 

N|      JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE 

N|      her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN 

N|      stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him 

N|      questioningly. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 Are you all right Ethan.  What's wrong

D|                 with you? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 If you're gonna do this again Claire, 

D|                 It's not gonna be on my watch. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 Oh yeah? 

 | 

N|      JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE 

N|      her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN 

N|      stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him, 

N|      questioningly. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Claire. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Jack. 

 | 

N|      She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her 

N|      finger.  ETHAN notices.  He turns and SHOUTS to the room at 

N|      large. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

 |                 IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT 

 |                 OUT OF HERE YET?! 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Just waiting for you, tubs. 

 | 

N|      He walks across the room and out the door.  CLAIRE, worried, 

N|      clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding 

N|      ring. 

 | 

N|      We move in on it --

 | 

M|                                                             CUT TO: 

 | 

S|      INT. JET - DAY

 | 

N|      -- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a MAN's 

N|      finger. One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the 

N|      plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner.  He shoves 

N|      some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a 

N|      fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE. 

 | 

N|      The pilot's voice makes an announcement. 

 | 

C|                           VOICE (O.S.)

D|                 Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off 

D|                 at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight 

D|                 thousand feet-and we should be arriving 

D|                 in Prague right on schedule. 

 | 

N|      A FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats, passing 

N|      out menus. 

 | 

C|                           FLIGHT ATTENDANT 

D|                 Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? 

 | 

N|      A passenger takes one.  The ATTENDANT continues on. 

 | 

C|                           FLIGHT ATTENDANT 

C|                           (CONT'D) 

D|                 Would you like to watch a movie Mr 

D|                 Phelps? 

 | 

N|      The MAN with the wedding ring looks up.  JIM PHELPS is in his 

N|      mid-forties, good-looking, intense.  He's a tired man, and 

N|      not just now, it's a profound fatigue.  He looks up at the 

N|      ATTENDANT and smiles warmly. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 No, I prefer the theatre.  

 | 

N|      A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes 

N|      stilted. 

 | 

C|                           FLIGHT ATTENDANT 

D|                 Would you consider the cinema of the

D|                 Ukraine? 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Perhaps you'd choose one for me. 

 | 

N|      The ATTENDANT turns and walks away.  PHELPS sits back, shakes 

N|      a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the 

N|      armrest. 

 | 

S|      AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN.

 | 

N|      The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8 

N|      cassettes of feature films.  She opens a panel in the top of 

N|      the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there. 

 | 

S|      BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT

 | 

N|      The ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS. 

N|      He takes it without a word and she moves on. 

 | 

N|      PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between 

N|      his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small 

N|      movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the 

N|      other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the 

N|      armrest, and puts the tape in. 

 | 

N|      He presses play.

 | 

S|      ON THE TAPE, 

 | 

N|      the image of a man comes on.  EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, 

N|      but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed 

N|      glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than 

N|      tieless.  But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever 

N|      look away.  He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

M|                      (on the tape) 

D|                 Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're 

D|                 about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- 

 | 

N|      The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man 

N|      in his forties.  The image is herky-jerky videotape, 

N|      presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks 

N|      down a foreign street. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 

D|                 -- a former KGB Line X officer now 

D|                 working the international black market 

D|                 selling intelligence.  This morning, we 

D|                 learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half 

D|                 of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- 

D|                 official cover agents working in Eastern 

D|                 Europe. 

 | 

N|      The screen shows an image of what such a list might look 

N|      like, code names and other information scrolling by on a 

N|      computer screen at high speed. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 

D|                 For security reasons, the NOC list is 

D|                 divided into two encoded halves. 

D|                 Golitsyn already has the cryptonym 

D|                 portion, which contains agent code names 

D|                 and targeting areas.  This portion is 

D|                 useless unless combined with the second 

D|                 half -- the true name list that is kept 

D|                 in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. 

 | 

N|      The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building 

N|      at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava 

N|      River. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 

D|                 We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the 

D|                 true name list at an Embassy function 

D|                 tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you 

D|                 decide to accept it, is to obtain 

D|                 photographic proof of the theft, apprehend 

D|                 those involved, and return the stolen 

D|                 list.  I don't have to stress the 

D|                 importance of this matter, Jim.  We're 

D|                 keeping it internally black. Because of  

D|                 its urgency, I've already sent to Prague 

D|                 a team selected from your usual group. 

 | 

N|      Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already 

N|      seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 

D|                 Ethan Hunt will of course be your point 

D|                 man, as usual.  He's in Kiev; we're 

D|                 getting word to him now. 

 | 

S|      INT. JET - DAY

N|      PHELPS sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his 

N|      tired brow.  KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape.

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 

D|                 As always, should you or any member of 

D|                 your IM force be caught or killed, the 

D|                 Secretary will disavow all knowledge of 

D|                 your actions.  This tape will self- 

D|                 destruct in five seconds.  Good luck, 

D|                 Jim! 

 | 

N|      PHELPS inhales deeply -- 

 | 

N|      -- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder, sending up a 

N|      plume of wispy smoke -- 

 | 

N|      -- and PHELPS exhales, concealing the plume in a cloud of 

N|      cigarette smoke.

N|      SARAH and HANNA, a German woman in her mid-thirties enter. 

N|      Another legend:

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - PRAGUE - DAY 

 | 

N|      The IMF team's safe house is a sparsely furnished Prague 

N|      apartment with a panoramic view of the city. 

 | 

N|      The IMF team is scattered around the room. Sketches, pads, 

N|      overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere. 

N|      JACK and SARAH seated next to each other - JACK demonstrating 

N|      the VISCO glasses to her.  CLAIRE is seated opposite JACK at 

N|      the computer.  JIM and ETHAN are in the kitchen.  HANNAH 

N|      taking a roll of black-out curtain through the room. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Look to your right, then back to me. 

D|                 There's a camera built right into the 

D|                 bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and 

D|                 transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 Of course I can hear you. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 No, in your...ear piece. You have a 

D|                 lovely smile (eyes). Can you hear me 

D|                 now? 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 Loud and clear. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 What's going on? 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 I don't know. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Why don't you take a look? 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 Jack...that's spying. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 That's what we do isn't it? 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 Jack you're so wicked. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Too wicked to have a drink later? 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 I think I might just take that look. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN and JIM PHELPS are in a heated conversation. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more 

D|                 than ninety days leave coming. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. 

D|                 Take it all, if you want.  After this one. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 I thought I'd take some now. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

M|                      (quietly, to Ethan) 

D|                 What the hell's made you decide to take 

D|                 your leave at the worst possible time? 

D|                 Claire's in a weird mood too. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Oh?  What's the problem? 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 I don't know, I had to go to Chicago 

D|                 again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Tell you what? 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 When you started noticing your short term 

D|                 memory loss.  What the problem was you 

D|                 and Claire had in Kiev? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 What problem? 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

M|                      (laughs)

D|                 Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking

D|                 burnout here?

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 I guess. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Ethan, you can't burn out. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Why not? 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Because I can't afford it. And because 

D|                 you'd burn up before you'd burn out. 

 | 

N|      CLAIRE, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to 

N|      be the reference point in the following exchange: 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 How was Chicago? 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto 

D|                 dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the 

D|                 one about the astronaut who comes back 

D|                 from the first manned flight to Mars 

D|                 after two years?  His wife's got a year 

D|                 old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was 

D|                 it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh,

D|                 it was my friend Sammy."  She says it 

D|                 wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my 

D|                 friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, 

D|                 don't you think I have any friends of my 

D|                 own?!" 

 | 

N|      PHELPS laughs.  ETHAN doesn't.  The back of CLAIRE'S head is 

N|      in his line of sight. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS (CONT'D) 

D|                 Boy, you really are grim. Come here, 

D|                 take a look. 

 | 

N|      He leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city.

N|      ETHAN nods.

C|                           PHELPS (CONT'D) 

D|                 Beyond Charles Bridge there is our 

D|                 Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if 

D|                 anything goes wrong, this guy will steal 

D|                 the names of our agents in every country 

D|                 all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to 

D|                 the highest bidders -- third world 

D|                 terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- 

D|                 any and everybody who'd love to get rid 

D|                 of long term coverts like us, and some 

D|                 very dear friends among them.  If they're 

D|                 exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over 

D|                 here.  Take a lock at this. 

 | 

N|      CLAIRE, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a 

N|      quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  In it, an old 

N|      edition of the McLaughlin Report, the PBS news show, is 

N|      playing. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN is distracted by it.

S|      INSERT - TELEVISION

 | 

N|      SENATOR WALTZER, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, 

N|      is holding forth: 

 | 

C|                           SENATOR WALTZER 

D|                 I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA 

D|                 and all its shadow organizations have 

D|                 become irrelevant at best and 

D|                 unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we 

D|                 throw a little light on the whole concept 

D|                 of the Pentagon's "black budget."  These 

D|                 covert agency subgroups have confidential 

D|                 funding, they report to no one -- who are

D|                 these people?!  We were living in a 

D|                 democracy the last time I checked.

S|      BACK TO SCENE

N|      ETHAN looks back at JIM.

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 You're going to use Walter?

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 He's our guy.

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Not this week. This week he's flyfishing 

D|                 at the Oughterard Slough in County 

D|                 Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 He won't be back in a hurry? 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? 

D|                 You think the plot'll work? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Sure.  If the main character does. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 If you were me, Ethan, who would you

D|                 trust to make him believable? 

 | 

N|      JACK comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum.

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Sorry, am I interrupting?

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Always. 

 | 

N|      JACK shows the gum to ETHAN.

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Stick of gum. If you come up against a 

D|                 lock you can't pick -- 

 | 

N|      Half the gum is red, the other half is green. 

 | 

C|                           JACK (CONT'D) 

D|                 Red light.  Green light.  Mash them 

D|                 together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on 

D|                 you -- you have five seconds. 

 | 

N|      He offers the gum to ETHAN.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Are you gonna take it? 

 | 

N|      CLAIRE glances up from the computer and catches ETHAN's eye. 

N|      PHELPS may have caught the glance, but is focused on ETHAN. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

M|                      (relenting) 

D|                 Give me the God damn gum.

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Just don't chew it.

S|      EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River.  Party 

N|      at the Embassy tonight. 

 | 

S|      INT. AN ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

 | 

N|      JACK, wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking 

N|      eyeglasses (they're called Visco glasses), enters an elevator 

N|      shaft through a small door at the base of the wall.  He looks 

N|      up the shaft, shining a flashlight until he finds what he's 

N|      looking for -- 

 | 

N|      -- a gray metal box, protruding from the wall one floor up. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      PHELPS is at a table in the safe house apartment, watching 

N|      the bank of monitors HANNAH wired together earlier. The 

N|      monitors are alive now, showing various views of the inside 

N|      of the Embassy, where the party is going on, and one view of 

N|      the elevator shaft. 

 | 

N|      PHELPS wearing an IMF headset and speaks into the mouthpiece. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Ethan.  Jack's inside.  Window's open by 

D|                 twenty-three hundred. 

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      Inside the Embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair 

N|      that's in full swing on the second floor. 

 | 

N|      SENATOR WALTZER, the man who was on TV, walks up a grand 

N|      staircase, headed in.  An AMERICAN DIPLOMAT in a tuxedo 

N|      hurries up to him. 

 | 

C|                           DIPLOMAT 

D|                 How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, 

D|                 the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just 

D|                 steer you through the reception line here

D|                 --

 | 

N|      The DIPLOMAT pilots the SENATOR by one arm, guiding him to a 

N|      reception line at the base of the stairs to the party. 

 | 

C|                           DIPLOMAT (CONT'D) 

D|                 Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the 

D|                 director of the National Gallery -- Petr 

D|                 Brandl, the mayor of Prague -- 

 | 

N|      SARAH, a very attractive young American dressed in an elegant 

N|      gown, steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with 

S|      WALTZER. 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator? 

 | 

C|                           SENATOR WALTZER 

D|                 Of course I do.  How are you, Miss 

D|                 Norman? 

 | 

N|      He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so 

N|      SARAH whispers something in his ear. 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 He's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me. 

 | 

N|      Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team. 

 | 

N|      The SENATOR pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket 

N|      (and if we didn't know the SENATOR was ETHAN before, this 

N|      confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder. 

 | 

S|      UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE, 

 | 

N|      ALEKSANDER GOLITSYN, the Ukrainian, has just come in from 

N|      outside. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      PHELPS sees the SENATOR's point of view of GOLITSYN, through 

N|      the glasses, broadcast back to PHELPS' monitor.  He speaks 

N|      into his microphone. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Sarah, mark the package and go to two. 

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      SARAH still has the SENATOR's attention. 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 Your advance team mentioned you'd want a 

D|                 tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead 

D|                 and set that up for you -- 

 | 

C|                           SENATOR WALTZER 

D|                 Terrific.  Let's get going. 

M|                      (to the Diplomat) 

D|                 Will you excuse us?  

 | 

N|      He slips an arm around SARAH and they walk off, not into the 

N|      party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads 

N|      further into the Embassy.

C|                           DIPLOMAT 

D|                 Uh, sir? 

 | 

S|      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT                               

 | 

N|      JACK climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal 

N|      box.  He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a 

N|      noise from above.  He looks up and sees the elevator above 

N|      him descending. 

 | 

N|      JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. The 

N|      elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him 

N|      to the wall. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Great.  Come on. 

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT 

 | 

N|      As the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, 

N|      SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse.  But as 

N|      she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing 

N|      herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head.  He never 

N|      notices.  They move on and down the flight of stairs. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT     

 | 

N|      JIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party.  He looks 

N|      to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party, a jumpy 

N|      one, as someone hurrying up stairs. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go. 

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      On a flight of stairs, HANNAH, dressed for the party and 

N|      slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs. 

 | 

C|                           HANNAH 

D|                 En route. 

 | 

N|      She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the 

N|      party below.  She pushes a micro switch on the side of her 

N|      glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the 

N|      lenses. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS (O/S) 

D|                 Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to

D|                 night vision). 

 | 

N|      HANNAHíS VISCO POV 

 | 

N|      the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands 

N|      out.  That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green 

N|      where SARAH sprayed it. 

 | 

S|      INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

 | 

N|      The SENATOR (let's just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down 

N|      the stairs and pass a sign that says "Denied Area -- 

N|      Political Attaches Only."  ETHAN checks his watch.  23:00. 

 | 

N|      He nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an 

N|      elevator at the end of the corridor.  A sign in front of it 

N|      says "Out of Order."  They head for it anyway. 

 | 

N|      A MARINE GUARD appears from behind a side door, catching them 

N|      by surprise.  

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Governor's in position.  We have the elevator. 

 | 

C|                           GUARD 

D|                 Excuse me, can I help you? 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 -- which leads directly to the Denied 

D|                 Area, the only limited access area in the 

D|                 whole facility. 

 | 

N|      SARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking. 

 | 

C|                           SARAH (CONT'D) 

D|                 As you can see. this area has both a 

D|                 Marine guard and video surveillance, and 

D|                 is strictly monitored at all times. 

 | 

N|      She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank 

N|      and slides her thumb inside.  The panel lights up and flashes 

N|      a message -- "ACCESS DENIED."  SARAH and ETHAN trade a look. 

 | 

C|                           SARAH (CONT'D)

M|                      (covering) 

D|                 Senator, don't you have a young man on 

D|                 your staff named JACK? 

 | 

N|      She tries the thumb again, Still no soap. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Jack?  I believe we did have a young man 

D|                 named Jack.  Not a reliable man, as I 

D|                 recall.  Constantly late or behind in his 

D|                 work. 

 | 

N|      Now the GUARD, noticing that Sarah's not being allowed 

N|      access, comes closer to them. 

 | 

C|                           GUARD 

D|                 Excuse me, let me see that ID again! 

 | 

S|      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

 | 

N|      JACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening 

N|      to their conversation. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS (O.S.) 

D|                 Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a 

D|                 second.  Keep dancing.  

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (O.S.) 

M|                      (with the Senator's southern accent) 

D|                 We were forced to tie him to my best 

D|                 stallion and drag him around the barn a 

D|                 few times.  

 | 

N|      Finally, the elevator moves down a floor and JACK is freed. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on

D|                 it. 

 | 

N|      He quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of 

N|      circuitry.  He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the 

N|      elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download.

 | 

S|      THE LAPTOP

 | 

N|      there's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID 

N|      picture.  JACK downloads her file into the security computer. 

 | 

S|      INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

 | 

N|      Ignoring the GUARD, SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the 

N|      thumbprint analyzer once more.  The panel glows, this time 

N|      the message flashes -- 

 | 

C|                           IDENTITY CONFIRMED 

 | 

N|      -- and the elevator doors slide open briskly.  

 | 

N|      The GUARD, surprised, now catches sight of the SENATOR. 

 | 

C|                           GUARD 

D|                 Oh. Sorry, sir. 

 | 

N|      He snaps a salute.  ETHAN and SARAH get into the elevator and 

N|      the doors close behind them. 

 | 

S|      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

 | 

N|      JACK looks down at the elevator below.  Through a grating, he 

N|      can see them inside. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 The drink (date) with Sarah is definitely

D|                 off. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      PHELPS moves from JACK's view of the elevator car to HANNAH's 

N|      view of the party on his video monitors. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

M|                      (a touch of impatience) 

D|                 Hannah -- I'm blind again.  Hannah. 

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      HANNAH, stationed on the second floor of the Embassy, moves 

N|      to get a better view of the party. She reacquires GOLITSYN's 

N|      glowing head.  

 | 

C|                           HANNAH 

D|                 He's heading to the denied area. 

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

 | 

N|      This work room is filled with combination lock filing 

N|      cabinets and various computer terminals.  ETHAN hands SARAH 

N|      his Visco glasses and she crosses the room, placing them 

N|      upside down on top of a filing cabinet.  

 | 

N|      ETHAN straps on a Visco wrist monitor and tunes it in, 

N|      switching several times. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

M|                      (to Sarah) 

D|                 Higher.  Higher.  

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 Higher. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Right, right.  Good. 

 | 

N|      SARAH adjusts the glasses. 

 | 

S|      THROUGH THE GLASSES, 

 | 

N|      the view of the main computer terminal is upside down, but 

N|      clear.  Anyone sitting there will be recorded. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      On PHELPS' monitor, we see ETHAN, via his Visco glasses on 

N|      the filing cabinet, standing next to the computer.  PHELPS 

N|      barks out a warning.  

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Get moving, Ethan.  He's rolling to you. 

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN pushes the elevator button but the elevator is already 

N|      moving up. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Jack we're in position. 

 | 

S|      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT/WORK ROOM - NIGHT

 | 

N|      In a split view, we see both sides of the elevator wall 

N|      simultaneously -- on one side, JACK is lying on top of the 

N|      rising elevator, on the other side, ETHAN and SARAH are 

N|      waiting for it to arrive. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Jack.  Jack. 

 | 

C|                           JACK 

D|                 I didn't touch it. 

 | 

N|      The elevator stops, the doors open -- 

 | 

N|      -- and GOLITSYN gets on.  GOLITSYN descends in the elevator 

N|      with JACK on top and ETHAN and SARAH waiting down below! 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      PHELPS sees JACK's point of view of the elevator, with 

N|      GOLITSYN inside.  

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

M|                      (tension rising) 

D|                 He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box! 

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN and SARAH are waiting in front of the elevator, the one 

N|      GOLITSYN is about to step off of!  ETHAN looks around, for a 

N|      place to hide. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open

D|                 the doors. 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 What about my coat?  I'll freeze. 

 | 

C|                           JACK (O.S.) 

D|                 I don't have it. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 

 | 

N|      PHELPS whips over to a laptop and starts typing. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 Opening the doors.  Go under. 

 | 

N|      He jabs ENTER on his keyboard. 

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

 | 

N|      The elevator doors WHISK open, revealing the empty shaft 

N|      beyond.  ETHAN and SARAH jump into the shaft. 

 | 

S|      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN and SARAH jump down into the five foot empty space 

N|      below the work room floor.  Above them, the elevator 

N|      continues its descent, with them hiding below.  The elevator 

N|      drops to just over their heads and stops. 

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

 | 

N|      GOLITSYN steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides 

N|      a 3.5 computer disk into the computer in the work room. 

N|      Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, 

N|      downloading the vital information. 

 | 

S|      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

 | 

N|      Waiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, 

N|      starting to reverse it.  He checks his Visco wrist monitor as 

N|      GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft.  He smiles and speaks into a 

N|      microphone.  

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack. 

 | 

C|                           JACK (O.S.) 

D|                 Give me a break, Pops. 

 | 

C|                           SARAH 

D|                 Such a nice ass. 

 | 

C|                           JACK (O.S.) 

D|                 And a lonely ass. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport 

D|                 in five minutes. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE (O.S.) 

D|                 Roger that. 

 | 

S|      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

 | 

N|      Back inside, ETHAN strips off his mask and wearing his now 

N|      reversed jacket, he and SARAH exit the small door at the base 

N|      of the elevator shaft. 

 | 

S|      EXT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

 | 

N|      JACK rapidly disconnects his equipment.  But as he pulls the 

N|      final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes 

N|      and SPARKS. 

 | 

S|      EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN and SARAH exit an Embassy service area by the 

N|      waterfront and blend into the Embassy crowd, as an amorous 

N|      couple. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 In position.  Jack open the door, let the

D|                 package roll.

 | 

C|                           JACK (O.S.)

D|                 Roger that.  Opening doors now.

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to

D|                 transport.

N|      ETHANíS voice comes over HANNAHíS earpiece.

C|                           HANNAH

D|                 En route.

N|      HANNAH breaks off and goes up the stairs.

N|      The button marked "ROOF" lights up, seemingly all by itself.

N|      The car engages with a sharp jolt --

C|                           JACK

D|                 Hey.

N|      --and starts to rise.  JACK looks down, into the elevator

N|      car, through the grate.  Thereís no one in it.

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      On one of his monitors, PHELPS sees the elevator moving in

N|      the shaft.

N|      JACKíS face pales.  He looks up, above him, at the

D|                 Uh -- then I have a problem.

S|      INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

N|      GOLITSYN pulls out the now-programmed disk from the computer,

N|      slips it in his jacket pocket and heads for the door.

S|      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

N|      JACK looks up through his Visco glasses at the approaching

N|      roof, covered with spikes.

 | 

S|      EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      Through the monitor, ETHAN sees JACKíS P.O.V. of the roof of

N|      the building approaching.  Fast.

S|      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

N|      On top of the elevator, JACK has ripped open the control

N|      panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get

N|      the thing to stop.

 | 

N|      He swears, his fingers fumble, he works faster and faster.

N|      He looks up.  The roof of the building is nearly upon him.

N|         

C|                           ETHAN (O.S.)

D|                 Come on, Jack, come on.

N|      JACK looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his

N|      hands, he SCREAMS --

 | 

N|      --and heís crushed to death against the roof.

S|      EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

N|      ETHAN is staring at the static on the monitor that once was

N|      JACKíS signal.

N|      PHELPS also sees the static.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 Man down.  Stay where you are.  Iím on my

D|                 way.

 | 

N|      He gets up and races out of the apartment.

 | 

S|      INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

 | 

N|      GOLITSYN, who now has the disk, jabs again and again at the

N|      elevator button but it wonít even light up.  He studies the

N|      elevator doors and jumps into the shaft, just as ETHAN and

N|      SARAH did moments before.

 | 

N|      He hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small

N|      door at the shaftís base.

 | 

S|      EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      PHELPS hurries towards the bridge.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 En route.

 | 

S|      EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      PHELPS dashes onto the Charles Bridge and heads across the

N|      river, toward the Embassy.  He throws a look back, over his

N|      shoulder.  Paranoiaís setting in.

 | 

S|      EXT. EMBASSY (AS SEEN FROM CHARLES BRIDGE) - NIGHT

 | 

N|      Outside the Embassy, GOLITSYN escapes, pushing through the

N|      service area door and racing past a DRUNKEN COUPLE who are in

N|      the midst of a loverís quarrel, in Russian.

 | 

N|      Pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where PHELPS is

N|      still racing to meet ETHAN.  But he stops suddenly, as if

N|      hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening

N|      gloom.

 | 

S|      EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN and SARAH hear PHELPíS voice over the monitor.

 | 

C|                           SARAH

D|                 The package is in the open.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS (O.S.)

D|                 Iíve got a shadow.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Can you lose him?

 | 

C|                           PHELPS (O.S.)

D|                 No.  Abort.

 | 

N|      Over ETHANís shoulder, SARAH sees GOLITSYN getting away.  Fog

N|      starts to roll over the river towards the bridge.

 | 

C|                           SARAH

D|                 Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.                

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

M|                      (to Phelps) 

D|                 Jim we canít.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS (O.S.)

D|                 Abort.  Thatís an order.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Negative, Golitsynís on the move.

 | 

S|      INT. GETAWAY CAR - NIGHT

 | 

N|      Seated in the getaway car, CLAIRE listens to JIM and ETHAN

N|      argue.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS (O.S.)

D|                 No, damn it, no, I said ABORT!

 | 

S|      EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      Outside the Embassy, SARAH and ETHAN argue.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím

D|                 coming to you.

 | 

C|                           SARAH

D|                 Jim gave an abort, we should walk

D|                 away.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 No, weíre going to recover the disk,

D|                 understand?!  Now move!

 | 

N|      ETHAN takes off for the bridge, leaving SARAH to shadow

S|      GOLITSYN.

 | 

S|      EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT

 | 

N|      HANNAH hurries toward the getaway vehicle.

 | 

S|      EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN moves to the bridge stairs.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS (O.S.)

D|                 Where are you?

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 About two hundred yards from the bridge.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS (O.S.)

D|                 Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan.

D|                 Cut all radio communications.  Repeat.

D|                 Cut all radio communications.  

 | 

N|      ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge.  Past

N|      CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car.  He looks on his monitor

N|      and again sees PHELPSí POV.  Only ominous silence.  Phelps is

N|      looking back over his shoulder.  The bridge is deserted.

 | 

S|      EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

 | 

N|      SARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where

N|      a cobblestone promenade runs along the river.  He disappears

N|      into the fog at the edge of the river.

 | 

S|      EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN checks his monitor again.

 | 

S|      THE MONITOR

 | 

N|      PHELPSí point of view changes radically as his head swivels

N|      on the darkened bridge.  He whirls again, looking over his

N|      shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible,

N|      pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a

N|      GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor.

 | 

N|      The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down

N|      to a bloody hole in his own chest.

 | 

N|      His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge

N|      and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.

N|         

S|      EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHANís face goes white with shock.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

 |                 JIM!

 | 

S|      EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but thereís

N|      no sign of PHELPS.

 | 

N|      ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but

N|      sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming

N|      obscured in the gathering fog.

 | 

N|      He turns and looks to the embankment.  He can faintly see

N|      GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade.  ETHAN gives chase.

 | 

S|      EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point

N|      on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIREíS outline,

N|      visible in the driverís seat.  But as he descends the stairs

N|      --

 | 

N|      --the car explodes and bursts into flames.

 | 

N|      The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

 |                 CLAIRE!

 | 

N|      He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a 

N|      stunned CROWD starts to gather.

 | 

N|      Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the

N|      embankment.

 | 

S|      EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

 | 

N|      SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees

N|      GOLITSYN again, slowing down.  A MAN comes out of the fog an

N|      seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light.

 | 

N|      SARAH draws closer.  Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to

N|      be hanging with her for some reason.

 | 

S|      EXT. STAIRS FROM BRIDGE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN continues towards the embankment.

 | 

S|      EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

 | 

N|      SARAH is almost to GOLITSYN.  Suddenly, the MAN in front of

N|      GOLITSYN pulls him towards him.  Sensing something wrong,

N|      SARAH quickens her pace.  The MAN is now hunched over

N|      GOLITSYN, facing away from SARAH, going through GOLITSYNís

N|      pockets.

 | 

N|      The figure finds what itís looking for -- the disk -- and

N|      takes it.  SARAH comes closer --

 | 

N|      -- and the figure whirls.  It brings a knife up sharply,

N|      plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.

 | 

S|      ANGLE

 | 

N|      ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment.  He bursts

N|      out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees,

N|      over GOLITSYNís body.  ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and

S|      GASPS.

 | 

N|      He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death.  He

N|      looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated

N|      edge.

 | 

S|      BEHIND ETHAN

 | 

N|      The DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more.  In fact, theyíre

N|      watching ETHAN.  Through the fog and night, they see him

N|      leaning over SARAH, holding the knife in his hands.

 | 

S|      AT THE BODIES

 | 

N|      SARAH goes still.  ETHAN lays her down, turns the other body

N|      over and sees that it is GOLITSYN.  He quickly begins

N|      rummaging through his pockets.

 | 

N|      ETHAN hear police sirens and sees...

 | 

S|      ANGLE

 | 

N|      A Prague police boat, SIREN wailing, arrives at the dock in

N|      front of the Embassy.  The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop

N|      suddenly.

 | 

N|      As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the

N|      explosion, ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley

N|      and out of sight.

 | 

S|      EXT. STREET -- PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver.  Heís

N|      holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a 

N|      modernist cockroach.  He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts

N|      of the phoneís wiring, piercing it with its little prongs.

 | 

N|      He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phoneís tongue

N|      down for a second, releases it and listens.  He has a dial

N|      tone.  Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by

N|      heart.

 | 

N|      After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side.

 | 

C|                           FLAT VOICE (O.S.)

D|                 Satcom seven.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Central Europe.  Unsecured.

 | 

C|                           FLAT VOICE (O.S.)

D|                 Designator?

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Bravo Echo one one.

 | 

C|                           FLAT VOICE (O.S.)

D|                 Switching.

 | 

N|      There is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the

N|      line.

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

D|                 This is Kittridge.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Go secure.

 | 

N|      Pause.  A funny series of CLICKS comes over the line.      

N|         

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

D|                 Go ahead.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Theyíre dead.

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

D|                 Whoís dead?

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim -

D|                 - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know

N|         

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

D|                 Are you damaged?

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís

D|                 dead too.  The disk is gone.

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

D|                 Are you intact?

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Do you read me?  The list is in the open!

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

D|                 Let's just bring you in safely, and then

D|                 we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you

D|                 followed?

 | 

N|      ETHAN closes his eyes.  KITTRIDGEíS voice is strong and

N|      reassuring and he needs that right now.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 I donít think so.

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

D|                 Donít think, be sure.  Are you clean?

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Yes.

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

D|                 Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there

D|                 myself.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Youíre in Prague?

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

D|                 Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít

D|                 disappoint me.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 No sir.

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

D|                 One hour.

 | 

N|      He hangs up.  ETHAN does the same.  He stares at the phone

N|      for a moment, thinking.  He checks his watch.

 | 

S|      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the

N|      street.  Every face seems to be starring at him now, every

N|      sound is menacing.  He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his

N|      hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd.

 | 

S|      EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering,

N|      gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by 

N|      residential buildings.

 | 

N|      ETHANíS POV

 | 

N|      Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built

N|      on the portico of an old palace.

 | 

N|      Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively

N|      shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza.

 | 

S|      INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

 | 

S|      ETHAN'S POV 

 | 

N|      ETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an 

N|      enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. 

N|      He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are 

N|      scattered around. 

 | 

N|      EUGENE KITTRIDGE is seated at a table in the middle. He and 

N|      ETHAN make eye contact.  ETHAN walks to the table, a couple 

N|      of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he 

N|      goes.  KITTRIDGE has been working on a pretty good-sized 

N|      lobster.  He rises to greet ETHAN and they sit. 

C|                           

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know 

D|                 how much Jim in particular meant to you, 

D|                 Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Yeah. 

 | 

N|      He spots a stack of documents on the table.

 | 

N|      ETHAN picks them up.  There's a Canadian picture bearing 

N|      ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, 

N|      driver's license, etc. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE

D|                 Passport, visas - you know the drill. 

D|                 We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, 

D|                 debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague 

D|                 police a bone, you know toss them a few 

D|                 suspects.  Follow me? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Yeah.  I follow you. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 We've lost enough agents for one night. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 You mean I've lost enough agents for one 

D|                 night. 

 | 

N|      KITTRIDGE seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, 

N|      carefully: 

N|         

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, 

D|                 Ethan. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Who else is left? 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 Yes.  I see your point. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Why was there another team? 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 What? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 I don't quite follow you. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Let's see if you can follow me around 

D|                 this room. 

M|                      (eyes moving around the room) 

D|                 The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 

D|                 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing 

D|                 around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. 

D|                 The waiter behind Hannah at the top of 

D|                 the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The 

D|                 other IMF team.  You're worried about me. 

D|                 Why?

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

M|                      (a tight little smile) 

D|                 You're right.  Maybe this'll save some 

D|                 time. 

 | 

N|      The figures around the room have grown restless.  KITTRIDGE 

N|      tries to indicate that it's okay. He pulls some papers out 

N|      of his jacket. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 

D|                 For a little over two years now we've 

D|                 been spotting serious blowback in IMF 

D|                 operations.  We have a penetration.  The 

D|                 other day we decoded a message on the 

D|                 Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 The arms dealer. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 That's right.  Max, it seems, has two 

D|                 unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity

D|                 and for corrupting susceptible agents. 

D|                 This time he's gotten to someone on the 

D|                 inside - he's put himself in a position 

D|                 to buy our NOC list. An operation he 

D|                 referred to as "Job 314".  The job he 

D|                 thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 Correct the actual list is safe at 

D|                 Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, 

D|                 one of ours. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 This whole operation was a molehunt. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like 

D|                 you said.  You survived. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN stares at him levelly. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)

D|                 I want to show you something, Ethan. 

 | 

N|      He now shoves the papers across the table.  They're xeroxed 

N|      copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and 

N|      MARGARET ETHAN HUNT.  It shows a balance of $127, 000. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 

D|                 Since your father's death, your family's 

D|                 farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, 

D|                 suddenly, they're flush with over a 

D|                 hundred and twenty grand in the bank. 

D|                 Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped 

D|                 out the bank account -- dying slowly in 

D|                 America after all, can be a very 

D|                 expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why 

D|                 don't we go quietly out of here onto the 

D|                 plane... 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 How about if we just go quietly into the 

D|                 bathroom and I wash your mouth out with 

D|                 soap - you pathetic button down 

D|                 bureaucratic asshole. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 

D|                 Ethan, I can understand you're very 

D|                 upset. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Kitteridge, you've never seen me very 

D|                 upset. 

 | 

N|         ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket.  While 

N|         KITTRIDGE talks, ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand. 

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 All right, enough is  enough Hunt. You've 

D|                 bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on 

D|                 intimate loyalties to get away with it. 

D|                 You're determined to shake hands with the 

D|                 devil and I'm going to make sure you do 

D|                 it in hell. 

 | 

N|      We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- it's the piece of 

N|      bubble gum, half red, half green. He squeezes the gum, 

N|      mushing the two sides together. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN lashes out, swatting KITTRIDGE'S glass of wine off the

N|      table in one quick motion.  As he does, he hurls the piece of 

N|      gum. 

 | 

N|      Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine 

N|      glass.  KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- 

 | 

N|      -- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. His eyes 

N|      widen.  KA BOOM! 

 | 

N|      The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish 

N|      tank.  A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and 

N|      WOMAN, knocking them to the ground. 

 | 

N|      At the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door. 

 | 

S|      EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the 

N|      deserted square. 

 | 

S|      EXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      Silence.  ETHAN enters the darkened entry. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN glances up at the stairwell.  Naked light bulbs 

N|      illuminate the way up.  He slips off his jacket and shirt, 

N|      then puts his jacket back on. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN unscrews a bulb.  He crushes the bulb in his shirt and 

N|      scatters the glass fragments on the steps.  He climbs to the 

N|      next bulb. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT

 | 

N|      At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft 

N|      sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments 

N|      dropping and ETHAN'S at the door. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 

 | 

N|      In the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with 

N|      flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a 

N|      Sig Sauer automatic. He moves through the rooms, checking 

N|      them as he goes. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, 

N|      pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can.  He 

N|      unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various 

N|      denominations from various countries and a couple of 

N|      passports. 

 | 

N|      As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the

N|      mirror.  He's a mess.  He splashes water on his face. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water 

N|      and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

 | 

N|      He comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he 

N|      notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the 

N|      static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching.  One by 

N|      one, he switches them off. 

 | 

S|      THE LAPTOP 

 | 

N|      JACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk.  ETHAN 

N|      wakes it up. 

N|         

N|      The computer emits a DIAL TONE, then STATIC as it hits its 

N|      connection.  It prompts ETHAN along: 

 |

S|      ETHAN TYPES IN

N|      ETHAN tries again:

 | 

N|      The answer: 

 |

 | 

N|      He tries a few more, quickly -- "job," "jobs," "joblist.com," 

N|      but nothing comes up.  He tries something else -- "scroll 

N|      usenet groups."  

 | 

N|      The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying 

N|      speed, by the hundreds.  That's not going anywhere. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to 

N|      figure out what permutation of "job 314" he should add to the 

N|      others on his computer screen.  He MUMBLES.

D|                 It's Job!

N|      He rummages around on the desk, checks the bookshelf and 

N|      finds a Gideon Bible.  He turns to Job 3:14 and reads the 

N|      Bible passage "Kings and Counsellors..." 

 | 

N|      He thinks for another moment, then punches back into the 

N|      Internet and under the command "Select Usenet Group" he 

N|      types:

S|      ANGLE

 | 

N|      A rhythmic CRUNCHING sound and from the darkness on the other 

N|      side of the room, PHELPS staggers toward him, wet and muddy, 

N|      his middle a hopelessly bloody mess.  He looks like he's 

N|      dying on his feet.  ETHAN freezes, appalled. 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 Ethan, what are you doing? 

 | 

N|      ETHAN tries to speak but nothing will come out.

C|                           PHELPS (CONT'D) 

D|                 I needed you, Ethan. 1 needed you on the 

D|                 bridge, and -- you weren't there.  Ethan? 

D|                 Ethan? 

 | 

N|      ETHAN reaches out to grab PHELPS but can't seem to touch him. 

N|      PHELPS suddenly vanishes into thin air, ETHAN awakens from 

N|      the dream and finds himself leaping to his feet, gun cocked 

N|      and pointed at -- 

 | 

S|      ANGLE

 | 

N|      It's CLAIRE. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 What are you doing here?! 

 | 

N|      CLAIRE freezes, her hands half-raised.

C|                           CLAIRE 

M|                      (carefully) 

D|                 Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. 

D|                 Ethan what's wrong with you?

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Don't move.

N|      Her right hand has moved a fraction.  She freezes again. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 You were in the car!

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in 

D|                 trouble on the radio.  He said someone 

D|                 was... 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the 

D|                 car. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 No, I got out of the car and I ran to the

D|                 bridge. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.

D|                 What happened to Jim?

D|                 There was nobody on the bridge.

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 What happened to Jim?

N|      Ethan grabs her wrists, shouting. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Dead.  Dead.  Dead!  Wake up, Claire! 

D|                 Jim's dead, they're dead.  They're all 

D|                 dead! 

 | 

N|      ETHAN releases her wrists.

C|                           CLAIRE 

M|                      (mumbling) 

D|                 They're dead.  Jim's dead.

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Take off your coat.

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 What? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Take off your God damn coat! 

 | 

N|      He grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- 

N|      spinning her around.  The coat hits the floor like a dead 

N|      body.  CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest. 

 | 

N|      CLAIRE begins to shiver.  ETHAN circles her, runs his hand 

N|      cursorily across her body.  It accentuates CLAIRE'S 

N|      shivering. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (CONT'D) 

D|                 Where were you?

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 I walked away.  He said abort.  He was 

D|                 gone so I walked away. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? 

D|                 Did they send you here?

C|                           CLAIRE 

M|                      (slowly) 

D|                 Who is "they?"

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Did they send you...Did they send you?

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 Who is they, who is they? 

 | 

N|         ETHAN grabs her by the wrists. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Who sent you?!  Who sent you? 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

M|                      (screaming) 

D|                 No one sent me!  We're supposed to be 

D|                 back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, 

D|                 if we abort, we don't return here until 

D|                 four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, 

D|                 four o'clock --! 

 | 

N|      She sags.  A moment.  Then the clock begins to chime -- BONG, 

N|      BONG, BONG, BONG.  In the wake of the bells' reverb, ETHAN 

N|      releases his grip on her wrists. 

 | 

S|      INT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT

 | 

N|      ETHAN sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, 

N|      still waiting for a response.  CLAIRE sitting on the end of 

N|      the bed.  Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 Why haven't they brought us in yet?

D|                 I've been disavowed.  They think I killed 

D|                 Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred 

D|                 thousand dollars found its way into my 

D|                 parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes 

D|                 I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've 

D|                 been in the employ of an arms dealer, 

D|                 Max, for the last two years, to get him 

D|                 our NOC list. 

 | 

N|      A long moment while she stares at ETHAN's back. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 What are you going to do? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the 

D|                 mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, 

D|                 at least part of the time. 1 can't find 

D|                 him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, 

D|                 he'll find me. 

D|                 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me 

D|                 go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going 

D|                 to tell him you had nothing to do... 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not 

D|                 dead, he's going to assume you're with 

D|                 me. 

 | 

N|      The computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it. 

 | 

S|      THE COMPUTER SCREEN

 | 

N|      Blinking -- "MESSAGE WAITING."  ETHAN hurries over and clicks 

N|      on the message box.  The screen blinks and the message shows 

N|      up: 

 | 

N|      ?        JOB - CORNER OF NEKAZANKA AND PRlKOPY ONE P.M. 

 | 

S|      ?        BUY A PACKET OF DUNHILL

S|      ?        AND ASK THE MAN SITTING ON THE BUS

S|      ?        STOP BENCH FOR A MATCH

 | 

N|      CLAIRE looks to ETHAN. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 The message is for Job. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 I'm going to answer it. 

 | 

S|      EXT. STREET BY BANK/FLORENC BUS STOP - DAY

 | 

N|      ETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A 

N|      MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to 

S|      ETHAN. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Excuse me, could I trouble you for a 

D|                 match? 

 | 

N|      Without turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As 

N|      ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm 

N|      and escort him into a car which has just pulled up. 

 | 

S|      INT. CAR - DAY

 | 

N|      ETHAN slides into the back seat, between the TWO MEN. 

N|      MATTHIAS, the man on the left, holds up a black hood.  He 

N|      extends it to ETHAN, who doesn't take it. 

 | 

C|                           MATTHIAS

D|                 Would you remove your hat please? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Why? 

 | 

C|                           MATTHIAS 

D|                 You wish to meet Max?  This is the price 

D|                 of admission. 

 | 

N|      Reluctantly, Ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car 

N|      takes off. 

 | 

S|      INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

 | 

N|      The black hood still on his head, ETHAN has trouble sitting 

N|      upright.  He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in 

N|      the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are 

N|      drawn.  The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- 

N|      expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. 

 | 

N|      Somewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few 

N|      seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone 

N|      is VACUUMING.  MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 I thought I was going to see Max. 

 | 

C|                           MATTHIAS 

D|                 You misunderstood.  No one sees Max. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Then what am I doing here? 

 | 

C|                           MATTHIAS 

D|                 Allowing Max to see you and hear what 

D|                 you've got to say. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 I don't communicate very well through a 

D|                 shroud. 

 | 

C|                           MATTHIAS 

D|                 If Max doesn't like what you have to say, 

D|                 you'll be wearing that shroud 

D|                 indefinitely. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 I'm willing to take the chance. 

 | 

C|                           MATTHIAS 

D|                 Very well. 

 | 

N|      MAX'S figure into frame.  MATTHIAS removes ETHAN's hood. 

N|      When it comes off ETHAN finds himself looking up at a tall 

N|      woman of indeterminate age.  She's handsome to the point of 

N|      severity. 

 | 

C|                           MAX 

D|                 Who are you and what are you doing here? 

C|                           

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 I need one hundred thousand dollars. 

 | 

C|                           MAX

D|                 Really?  And you thought if you simply 

D|                 showed up I might give it to you? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and 

D|                 twenty five thousand. 

 | 

C|                           MAX 

D|                 The penny drops.  You are not Job.  Yes, 

D|                 Job is not given to quoting Scripture in 

D|                 his communications. And there was its 

D|                 tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is 

D|                 not playful.  So you're something of a 

D|                 paradox. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 That depends. 

 | 

C|                           MAX

D|                 On what? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Whether you like a paradox.  I want a 

D|                 hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 

 | 

C|                           MAX

D|                 It's quite out of the question. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's 

D|                 bait, part of an internal molehunt. 

 | 

C|                           MAX

D|                 And how might you know that?  Are you 

D|                 another Company man? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Like Job? 

 | 

C|                           MAX 

D|                 Ah, but, we're asking about you. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 I'm NOC.  Was.  Now disavowed. 

 | 

C|                           MAX 

D|                 Why, may I ask? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 That's the question I want to ask Job. 

 | 

C|                           MAX 

D|                 I don't know Job any more than he knows 

D|                 me. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an 

D|                 introduction. 

 | 

C|                           MAX 

D|                 Why should I? 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Because I can deliver the actual NOC 

D|                 list.  The one you have is not only 

D|                 worthless, it's certain to be equipped 

D|                 with a homing device to pinpoint your 

D|                 exact location. 

 | 

C|                           MAX 

D|                 It's easy to say the disk is worthless 

D|                 when you say I can't look at the 

D|                 information and see if it's worthless. 

D|                 Not a tenable position, sir. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from 

D|                 thirty seconds to ten minutes you're 

D|                 gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping 

D|                 around you like jackrabbits.

C|                           MAX 

M|                      (Pause.) 

D|                 Mm - Hmmm... 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner 

D|                 you used in the car? 

 | 

C|                           MAX 

D|                 Very good. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up 

D|                 first.

N|      MATTHIAS boots up.  There's a little musical noise and the 

N|      screen brightens.  The computer WHIRS and CLICKS and a 

N|      complex list of names, addresses, phone numbers and other 

N|      personal information scrolls by.  But Matthias is watching 

N|      the digital read-out on the RF scanner.

C|                           MATTHIAS 

D|                 Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so 

D|                 good.

C|                           MAX 

D|                 That's not so good for you, my friend.

N|      On the scanner, the digital read-out is now in the thirties.

C|                           MATTHIAS 

D|                 Thirty-two and change.

N|      She looks from the scanner to ETHAN as if she's trying to 

N|      make up her mind about something.

C|                           MATTHIAS 

D|                 Forty-four.  Forty-five.

D|                 I'd say you've got about two minutes.

N|      MAX still doubts it. The OTHER MAN goes to the windows --

N|      --nothing happens. He opens the French doors that lead out 

N|      onto a balcony.

S|      EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY

N|      The OTHER MAN comes out on the balcony.  Nothing out here but 

N|      a beautiful day.  He walks to the railing and looks down at 

N|      the street. 

 | 

N|      Down below, the dog that's still barking is tied to a street 

N|      sign.  WOOF.  WOOF.  WOOF.  Abruptly, it stops.

S|      EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT

N|      A pollution control van and a taxi arrive amidst other street 

N|      activity. KITTRIDGE and the FEMALE CZECH AGENT exit the taxi 

N|      as BARNES and TWO OTHER UNDERCOVER MALE IMF agents leave the 

N|      van.

S|      INT. MAX'S BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

N|      Led by KITTRIDGE, the FIVE IMF AGENTS wearing Kevlar-lined 

N|      trenchcoats creep through the lobby of the building and hit 

N|      the stairs. They climb them silently.

S|      INT. MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

N|      A CLEANING WOMAN is vacuuming the hall carpeting when the 

N|      AGENTS come up the stairs, guns drawn. Her jaw drops and she

N|      KITTRIDGE looks at her sharply and gestures.  She turns the 

N|      vacuum back on. They reach the door of a certain apartment 

N|      and -- 

 | 

S|      INT. APARTMENT - DAY

 | 

N|      -- KICK through it.  The AGENTS swarm into MAX'S apartment, 

N|      guns waving in all directions.  KITTRIDGE sweeps in between 

N|      them and takes command of the place --

N|      --but there's nobody here.  TWO AGENTS race into the bedroom,

N|      MAX manages to laugh without coughing.  Then, with an

D|                 I'm going to have to front you

D|                 without losing your life.

D|                 I wouldn't dream of it.

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the 

D|                 airport?  How many identities do you 

D|                 think Hunt has?  How many times has he 

D|                 slipped past custom, in how many 

D|                 countries?  These guys are trained to be

N|      ETHAN plugs the phone cable from his laptop into the back.

N|      The word "disavowed" dissolves slowly over the stateroom of a 

N|      high speed train, where the newly assembled IM force has 

N|      gathered around a table -- KRIEGER, a dangerous-looking 

N|      Frenchman of forty or so, LUTHER STICKELL, a muscular, soft- 

N|      spoken American in his mid-thirties.  ETHAN, and CLAIRE.

S|      INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY

 | 

N|      While ETHAN talks, we see what he's referring to: 

 | 

N|      A CIA ANALYST carrying a glass of iced tea and several file 

N|      folders walks down a long corridor in the headquarters 

N|      building.  He comes to an impressive guard station and rests 

N|      his chin on a strange-looking optometric device. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (V.O.) 

D|                 They missed nothing in that room.  Even 

D|                 the vents have laser nets over them.  

 | 

N|      Apparently the device approves and the ANALYST is buzzed into 

N|      a "RESTRICTED" area of the building. 

 | 

S|      INT. CIA COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY

 | 

N|      The ANALYST reaches a curtained area. He shoves the curtain 

N|      aside and comes to a large, vaulted door.  He slides a card- 

N|      key into a slot, leaves it there and slides a second card-key 

N|      into the slot beneath it. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (V.O.)

D|                 Inside, there are three countermeasure 

D|                 systems that can only be deactivated by 

D|                 authorized entry.  Which we won't have. 

 | 

N|      A panel next to the ANALYST says "INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES 

N|      OFF."  The ANALYST next spins a three digit combination code, 

N|      CHUNKS the door open and steps into -- 

 | 

S|      INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

 | 

N|      -- the secured terminal room.  It's not large but it's 

N|      impressive.  A single terminal is bolted into the middle of 

N|      the floor and the glass and tile walls of the room overlook 

N|      computer storage towers. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (V.O.) 

D|                 The first system is sound-sensitive, 

D|                 anything above a whisper sets it off. 

D|                 The second system is on the floor and 

D|                 pressure-sensitive --

 | 

N|      The ANALYST closes the vault door behind him and walks across 

N|      the room.  As he walks, the floor tiles light up under his 

N|      feet, turning off again when he lifts the weight from them. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (V.O.) 

D|                 --and the third detects any increase in 

D|                 temperature.  Even the body heat of an 

D|                 unauthorized person in the room will 

D|                 trigger it. 

 | 

N|      A thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is 72 

N|      degrees.  The ANALYST sets his glass down, boots up the 

N|      computer, and starts entering data from the file folders. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (V.O.) 

D|                 All three systems are state of the art. 

D|                 

N|      The ANALYST turns and takes a sip of his iced tea.  A drop of 

N|      condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor. When it 

N|      makes contact, the floor panel lights up. 

 | 

S|      INT. TRAIN STATEROOM - NIGHT

N|      The other team members gathered around the table look at 

N|      ETHAN skeptically.

C|                           LUTHER 

D|                 And you really think we can do this.

S|      INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT 

 | 

N|      The middle of the night and the train is dark. The team 

N|      members come out of the stateroom to go to bed -- KRIEGER 

N|      heads in one direction, ETHAN and CLAIRE in the other.

 | 

N|      ETHAN stops.  His attention is drawn to the car ahead. There 

N|      is a window in the door to the car and he looks through it. 

 | 

S|      ETHAN'S P.O.V. THRU WINDOW (INT. BUSINESS CAR - NIGHT)

 | 

N|      Ethan sees the business car, a plush space for busy 

N|      executives to get some work done on the train. There are 

N|      laptops, cellular phones, desks that fold out in front of 

N|      spacious seats. 

 | 

N|      A FEMALE EXECUTIVE, forty or so, is seated at one of the 

N|      desks, typing away into her laptop.

N|      ETHAN and CLAIRE enter, ETHAN closing the compartment door. 

N|      He pulls an envelope from his jacket and holds it out to her. 

N|      She takes it, waits.

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 It's cash. And a second passport. If 

D|                 anything goes wrong when we're inside, if 

D|                 you sense even the slightest deviation

D|                 didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just 

D|                 need you to be safe.

N|      CLAIRE's coolness causes ETHAN to hesitate just enough to 

N|      take it in.

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.. 

 | 

N|      And they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing 

N|      and half-falling onto the converted bed.  She suddenly 

N|      resists.  He senses it and pulls away.  

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Sorry. 

 | 

N|      He rises and goes to the door.  He's got his hand on the knob 

N|      when CLAIRE wraps her arms around him from behind, turns him 

N|      to her and kisses him, deeply.  This time they sink slowly to 

N|      the bed.

N|      KITTRIDGE, BARNES, and their STAFF are hard at work, 

N|      photographs and biographical data of ETHAN on various

D|                 What I want to know is how Hunt accessed

D|                 He may have used Phelps' code. They were 

D|                 friends, and Phelps, was still valid for 

D|                 twenty-four hours.

D|                 a system to immediately deactivate an 

D|                 agent's code immediately...

N|         KITTRIDGE brings his chair legs down on the floor with a

D|                 I can't believe what I'm listening to. 

D|                 Hunt just kicked us in the ass, you guys 

D|                 are standing here trying to figure out 

D|                 what kind of shoes he had on!  I don't

D|                 care how he did it, I want to know why he 

D|                 did it!  Is he recruiting?  For what 

D|                 purpose?

N|      From somewhere in the building, an ALARM sounds, not too loud

D|                 Too short sighted.  This guy's proactive,

N|      Three FIREMEN stomp into the main lobby of the CIA 

N|      headquarters building.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are among them, in 

N|      firemen's jumpsuits, carrying packs of equipment.  

 | 

N|      ETHAN takes a breath as they cross to the GUARD's desk.  He 

N|      looks up, above him. 

 | 

N|      Etched into the top of one wall are the words "AND YE SHALL 

S|      KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE."

 | 

N|      They reach the GUARD.  ETHAN, who wears Visco glasses, elbows 

N|      to the front of the group and takes charge.

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Yeah.  That's what I've got too.

N|      One fire truck is parked slightly behind the others in the 

N|      parking area of the headquarters building.  Second truck 

N|      roars past.  LUTHER watches it go.

S|      INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY

N|      LUTHER is in the belly of the fire truck with a ton of 

N|      equipment -- three laptops, a bundle of phone cable, a mini- 

N|      dish antenna, a cellular phone, several thick phone company 

N|      manuals with names like "COSMOS" and "SWITCHED ACCESS 

S|      SERVICE." 

 | 

N|      One laptop serves as a Visco monitor, showing a video image 

N|      in which LUTHER watches ETHAN'S point of view of the stubborn 

N|      GUARD, who's finishing his sentence. 

N|

N|      LUTHER turns to a screen on another computer and searches 

N|      through a complex facilities menu.

D|                 Let's move!

N|      ETHAN turns and looks at one of the FIREMEN behind them -- 

N|      it's CLAIRE.  CLAIRE and KRIEGER follow ETHAN/GUARD to 

N|      corridor. 

 | 

S|      INT. CIA STORAGE ROOM - DAY 

 | 

N|      CLAIRE quickly slips out of her fireman's jumpsuit, revealing 

N|      a business suit underneath.  She clips an ID tag to her 

N|      breast pocket.  

 | 

N|      She pulls a piece of paper from her pocket, a computer 

N|      printout of a man's ID photo.  She stares at the face, 

N|      studying it. 

 | 

S|      INT. CIA CAFETERIA - DAY 

 | 

N|      CLAIRE, carrying a cup of coffee and a muffin, looks for a 

N|      spot among the tables in the cafeteria of the headquarters 

N|      building. 

 | 

N|      She sees a MAN sitting alone, reading a newspaper.  It's the 

N|      man whose picture she looked at in the storage room.  She 

N|      sits next to him. 

 | 

N|      He looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile, then 

N|      goes back to his paper. 

 | 

N|      He turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing 

N|      the other way, CLAIRE pulls out a small vial resembling a 

N|      perfume sampler.  She dumps the clear liquid contents into 

N|      his coffee.  He turns back and hands her part of the paper. 

N|      CLAIRE smiles. 

 | 

N|      COFFEE MAN drinks up.  CLAIRE stares at his shoulder 

N|      strangely.  He notices. 

 | 

N|      She reaches out and flicks something off his shoulder blade. 

 | 

N|      He smiles.  But she hasn't flicked something off his shoulder 

N|      blade, she's flicked something onto it -- a little piece of 

N|      shiny gray metallic tape.  CLAIRE leaves the table. COFFEE 

N|      MAN drinks up and leaves the table. 

 | 

S|      INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY

N|      LUTHER stares at another one of his laptops, this one with a 

N|      blueprint of the inside of the building.  A cursor begins to 

N|      flash in one of the rooms.  LUTHER smiles.

D|                 William Donloe. 

 | 

N|      COFFEE MAN (ANALYST) walks past a GUARD desk and peers into 

N|      an optometric scanner and we suddenly remember where we've 

N|      seen COFFEE MAN before.  He's the TECHNICIAN who works at the 

N|      secured computer terminal.

S|      INT. CIA - SERVICE AREA - DAY

N|      ETHAN and KRIEGER in the service area - preparing.  ETHAN 

N|      putting the mask in a bag.

D|                 Where's the other guy? 

 | 

N|      The GUARD moves towards ETHAN, who kicks back at him, pushing 

N|      him back to KRIEGER, who zaps the GUARD on the back of the 

N|      neck.  He twitches and slumps to the ground, unconscious. 

N|      KRIEGER quickly grabs him around the neck. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN turns.  Holding the GUARD'S head with one hand, KRIEGER 

N|      pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with 

N|      the other.  He jabs it toward the base of the GUARD'S skull - 

 | 

N|      -- but ETHAN is on him in a flash.  He grabs KRIEGER's knife 

N|      arm shoving it up against the wall.  Staring into KRIEGER'S 

N|      face in warning.

S|      INT. VERTICAL DUCT - DAY 

 | 

N|      The Guard is tied up, lying on the floor of the Service Area 

N|      Room.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are below the open vent into the 

N|      duct system. 

 | 

N|      The first climb is straight up.  KRIEGER cups his hands under 

N|      ETHAN'S foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to 

N|      climb. 

 | 

S|      INT. DUCT - DAY 

 | 

N|      ETHAN and KRIEGER crawl quickly through the ducts, moving 

N|      horizontally now.  They reach a juncture and turn right.

C|                           ETHAN

 | 

N|      ETHAN and KRIEGER reach a ventilator shaft in the duct.  A 

N|      laser net protects the ventilator, red shafts of light cris- 

N|      crossing every which way.  ETHAN looks down, through the net. 

 | 

N|      He can see the computer room below and the top of the 

N|      TECHNICIAN'S head. 

 | 

S|      INT. DUCT - DAY                                              

 | 

N|      In the duct, ETHAN signals to KRIEGER, making a triangle of 

N|      his hands.  KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi- 

N|      sided, pyramid shaped glass object.  

 | 

N|      ETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of 

N|      the laser net's beams. The pyramid glows and we realise what 

N|      it is -- a prism. 

 | 

N|      The laser beam now captive in the prism, ETHAN carefully 

N|      moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and 

N|      directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the 

N|      shaft. 

 | 

S|      INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                             

 | 

N|      Up in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move 

N|      in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing.  When it appears ready 

N|      to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between 

N|      the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw. 

 | 

N|      The screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the 

N|      floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip 

N|      with a gentle CLICK, as to a magnet. 

 | 

N|      The screw is pulled up, through the shaft.  Now the whole 

N|      shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand. 

 | 

N|      It turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct. 

 | 

N|      A rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop 

N|      near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees.  A 

N|      gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the 

N|      tube, cooling the room. 

 | 

S|      INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

 | 

N|      The TECHNICIAN defaults the security systems outside the 

N|      terminal room. 

 | 

S|      INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

 | 

N|      It is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw 

N|      earlier.  No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the 

N|      gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use. 

 | 

N|      Now ETHAN's head descends slowly into the room, his hair 

N|      falling in front of him. 

 | 

N|      At first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, 

N|      but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then 

N|      shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his 

N|      ankles and understand.  

 | 

N|      He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and 

N|      temperature read out on the computer.  Suddenly ETHAN is 

N|      lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the 

N|      computer as the ANALYST enters the room.

N|      The TECHNICIAN crosses to the computer and sits down, a stack 

N|      of work to his right.

N|      The TECHNICIAN is working away at the computer.  He pauses 

N|      and wipes some sweat from his forehead.

N|      With a strange look on his face, the TECHNICIAN looks up. 

N|      It's almost as if he senses ETHAN above him but instead --

C|                           TECHNICIAN 

D|                 Oh, God. 

 | 

N|      -- he vomits.  

 | 

N|      He reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again.  Puzzled, 

N|      sick and feeling another wave coming on, he drags himself to 

N|      his feet, hauls himself across the room and leaves.

S|      INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY

N|      Even sick, the TECHNICIAN still thinks to re-activate the 

N|      alarm systems with a card-key.  They HUM back to life 

N|      efficiently, a light flashing:

N|      ETHAN descends again, slowly but steadily, until he is at the 

N|      same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in 

N|      front of the computer. 

 | 

N|      A heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together, secured by a 

N|      rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the 

N|      set of pulleys.

S|      INT. DUCT - DAY

N|      KRIEGER holds the rope, his jaw clenched, sweat breaking out 

N|      on his forehead.

S|      INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               

 | 

N|      Unfortunately, he's three feet away from it.  He stretches 

N|      his arms but can't reach. 

 | 

N|      He blinks, unable to believe this.  He curls himself into a 

N|      situp and looks up, into the shaft.

S|      INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

N|      ETHAN gestures to him, pointing to the floor.  Slowly, 

N|      KRIEGER drops him another few feet.  Now ETHAN's lower than 

N|      the terminal and still three feet away from it. 

N|         

N|      He closes his eyes, summoning his strength and does another 

N|      situp, bringing himself up right in front of the terminal.

N|      In the fire truck, LUTHER, who is watching on the Visco 

N|      monitor, turns his head upside down to get a look at what 

N|      ETHAN sees. 

 | 

N|      He cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and 

N|      begins to whisper.  We hear only the moist, airy sound of his 

N|      breath, not the words.

N|      ETHAN's ear receiver WHISPERS ever-so-slightly.  He reaches 

N|      out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it

N|      and starts typing, softly. 

 | 

N|      The computer HUMS, activated.  ETHAN unbuttons his pocket, 

N|      withdraws a 3.5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy 

N|      drive. 

 | 

N|      The computer accepts it with a soft WHIR.  ETHAN winces, even 

N|      that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances.  

 | 

N|      But no alarms go off.

N|      through ETHAN's trembling viewpoint.  He WHISPERS more

N|      KRIEGER shakes with the strain of holding the rope.  His eyes 

N|      suddenly widen as he sees something next to him. 

 | 

N|      It's a rat.  KRIEGER stares. The rat stares back.  Neither 

N|      moves.  Puzzled by KRIEGER'S lack of response, the rat crawls 

N|      forward, inquisitive.

N|      The 3.5 disk is ejected from the floppy drive.  ETHAN pockets 

N|      it and signals to be raised. 

 | 

N|      Slowly, his body starts to move up.  As it does, a bead of 

N|      sweat rolls down his nose, balling at the tip. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN ignores it.  But below him, he sees the floor tiles, 

N|      four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the 

N|      computer terminal.

N|      His eyes widen as he realizes something --

N|      A toilet FLUSHES, smashing the silence, and the TECHNICIAN 

N|      staggers out of the bathroom. He goes to the sink and throws 

N|      some water on his face. He's still unaware of the piece of

N|      more.  ETHAN looks up at him, wide-eyed and gestures to pull

N|      and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and 

N|      waiting on the tiny desk. 

 | 

N|      LUTHER, alone in a chair across the room. is seriously 

N|      preoccupied.  KRIEGER is sprawled-on a ratty sofa, hoisting a 

N|      lager and watching CNN. 

 | 

N|      CLAIRE is at the window staring out, anxious. 

 | 

N|      KRIEGER glances over the back of the sofa at ETHAN.

C|                           KRIEGER 

D|                 You contacting your buyer? 

M|                      (no answer) 

D|                 Ethan? 

 | 

N|      From the desk, ETHAN glances up.  Then goes back to the 

N|      computer.  KRIEGER continues to glare over the sofa back. 

 | 

C|                           KRIEGER (CONT'D) 

D|                 Ethan?  Oh, 'scuse me Mr. Hunt? 

 | 

N|      ETHAN ignores him, working.  His computer jams with static as 

N|      it connects to a BBS.  The screen blinks and displays the 

N|      familiar Bible group service through which he's contacted 

N|      Max.  When it asks him which chapter and verse for the 

N|      posting, ETHAN flicks through the Bible, looking for the next 

N|      code.  He  begins to type. 

 | 

D|                 MAX -- Now might be an excellent time 

D|                 to interpret Scripture face to face. 

D|                 Meet on TGV, noon tomorrow.  Take 

D|                 seat 27.  Bring our mutual friend 

D|                 Job.

 | 

N|      KRIEGER suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible 

N|      out of Ethan's hands to the floor. 

 | 

C|                           KRIEGER 

D|                 You're not going to any meeting without me. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 My contact is extremely shy. 

 | 

N|      He goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the 

N|      "ENTER" button. 

 | 

N|      LUTHER and CLAIRE watch this growing conflict closely. ETHAN 

N|      sighs and stands up.  KRIEGER pulls out the blue disk he took 

N|      from ETHAN in the computer room and waves it in front of him. 

 | 

C|                           KRIEGER 

D|                 I don't think you're in any position to 

D|                 give orders, do you?  Not while I'm 

D|                 holding this.

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 Krieger.

C|                           KRIEGER 

D|                 Stay out of this.

D|                 Lachez - moi

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Don't you mean this? 

 | 

N|      He reaches into his briefcase and pulls out an identical 

N|      disk.  He puts it back in his jacket pocket. 

 | 

N|      KRIEGER stares for a second. 

 | 

C|                           KRIEGER

D|                 That's not it.  That's not the list. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 What's the matter, you don't know this 

D|                 trick? 

 | 

N|      He holds the jacket pocket wide open, for KRIEGER to look 

N|      into.  KRIEGER does.  The pocket is empty. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (CONT'D) 

M|                      (mock surprise) 

D|                 Where did it go?!  It's GONE! 

 | 

N|      ETHAN walks over to CLAIRE, reaches into the pocket of the 

N|      trousers she's wearing and pulls out the disk. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (CONT'D) 

D|                 But not too far! 

 | 

N|      He palms the disk in his right hand. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (CONT'D) 

D|                 I know what you're thinking, Krieger. 

D|                 You're thinking, back in the computer 

D|                 room -- I was up here -- he was down 

D|                 there -- .  He was carrying two discs. 

 | 

N|      While he talks, he rotates his hand, palm away from KRIEGER. 

N|      When he rotates it back, the disk is gone again.  He holds up 

N|      his left hand.  It's there now. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN (CONT'D) 

D|                 So hard to keep track of these things. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN shows his hands -- now both are empty. 

 | 

C|                           KRIEGER 

M|                      (fuming) 

D|                 Where is it? 

 | 

N|      ETHAN pats his pockets, pretending to be frantic. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 I thought you had it!  Do you actually 

D|                 think I'd let you have the NOC list? 

 | 

N|      KRIEGER just stares at him, shaken.  CLAIRE laughs.  KRIEGER 

N|      looks at her.  He turns completely red.  When he looks back 

N|      at ETHAN, ETHAN holds two disks -- one in each hand. 

 | 

C|                           KRIEGER 

D|                 Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and 

D|                 Iíll cut your throat. 

 | 

N|      He tosses his worthless disk into the trash can and storms 

N|      out, SLAMMING the door behind him.  ETHAN picks up the Bible 

N|      and sees Drake Hotel. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've 

D|                 never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 We did what we had to do. 

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE 

D|                 I'm going to try and get some sleep.

N|      She leaves, closing the door behind her, leaving ETHAN and 

N|      LUTHER alone.

N|      ETHAN waits a moment, then casually walks to the trash can, 

N|      picks up the disk KRIEGER threw out and brushes it off 

N|      carefully. 

 | 

N|      He replaces it, in the trash, with the blue disk from his 

N|      jacket pocket.

N|      The wall clock is thirty seconds and counting down.  The

D|                 Can I ask you something, Kittridge?

D|                 crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five

N|      Click.  ETHAN has hung up.  KITTRIDGE looks hopefully to the 

N|      TECHNICIAN who says:

C|                           BARNES 

D|                 Lost him.  We needed three more seconds.

N|      Surprisingly KITTRIDGE is not as upset as he is puzzled.

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 He wanted us to know he was in London.

N|      Clearly that's the question that KITTRIDGE is turning over in 

N|      his mind and he doesn't have a simple answer to it.

N|      Close Digital clock.  It reads 23.59.  Angle widens to show 

N|      ETHAN looking at it with grim satisfaction.  He opens the 

N|      door of the phone booth and almost SMACKS right into -- 

 | 

N|      --the pale, weary, ghostlike figure of a man standing just 

N|      inches in front of him.  Startled, ETHAN looks up, but what 

N|      he sees shakes him to the core. 

 | 

N|      The man is JIM PHELPS. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN SHOUTS and almost falls back into the phone booth. 

N|      PHELPS leans against the door of the booth and smiles weakly.

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 You're a hard man to catch up with. 

D|

N|      ETHAN and PHELPS opposite one another in a booth, PHELPS 

N|      looking clammy and listing to one side.  But the banter 

N|      seems friendly and very quick - two friends and close 

N|      colleagues able to follow one another's reasoning easily, 

N|      finishing each other's sentences: 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 ..the next day I managed to drag myself 

D|                 to the safe house, must've just missed 

D|                 you..anyway, I checked our aliases.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 - and picked us up in the States -

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 - but you left before I could get there 

D|                 and I could check just so many places.. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize 

D|                 customs records - 

 | 

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 - so I watched Europe. Once you showed 

D|                 up in England..it was easy.

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool

D|                 I remember..

N|      PHELPS smiles warmly, has to steady himself to maintain an 

N|      upright position.  He opens a medicine bottle and takes the 

N|      pain killers.

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A 

D|                 doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't 

D|                 sit up straight.

C|                           PHELPS 

D|                 I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit 

D|                 up straight very well.  It's not 

D|                 important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I 

D|                 saw the mole.  It was Kittridge. 

M|                      (a fist into the table) 

D|                 Kittridge!

N|      building, watching it go and crush Kiefer.

D|                 - he shot you on the bridge - 

 | 

N|      On the Charles bridge PHELPS using the Visco glasses aims the 

N|      gun toward them, fires, cants the glasses and tosses them 

N|      into the Vltava River.

C|                           ETHAN VO

N|      Awkward moment.

D|                 have helicopter transport waiting in

D|                 Paris.

D|                 Jim...?

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you

D|                 and suddenly there she was, standing in

D|                 the rain just outside the safe

D|                 house..alive and beautiful..and thinking

D|                 Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís

D|                 had to do forget about me to keep going

D|                 and get the job done, I..

 | 

N|      PHELPS breaks off abruptly.  Apparently some inner struggle

N|      over this threatens to overwhelm him.  Then, controlling it:

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 - no.  She canít know about me.  No one

D|                 can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too

D|                 much at stake, Ethan.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Youíre probably right.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 I usually am.

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Once we leave the safehouse, get in there

D|                 and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.

D|                 You got it.

D|                 And get a doctor.

N|      door behind him.

N|      It is approximately one a.m. .  CLAIRE is huddled in the

N|      She draws him down by his hand to kiss her.

N|      He kisses her again, more fully.  She wraps an arm around him

N|      and he holds onto the kiss.  The room appears to revolve

N|      around them.

N|      Suddenly itís bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our

N|      eyes.

 | 

N|      KITTRIDGE and BARNES step off a military helicopter, blinking

N|      at the sunlight and hurry down the steps.

 | 

N|      TWO AGENTS immediately flank KITTRIDGE at the bottom and fall

N|      into step alongside, ready to brief him.  One of them holds

N|      out a small package with "for Job" written on it.

 | 

N|      KITTRIDGE looks at him.  He rips it open.  A note inside

N|      simply says:

C|                               Noon.

N|      KITTRIDGE looks at his watch.  Itís ten to twelve.

N|      As he reads the note, something else falls out of the

N|      envelope and CLUNKS to the ground.

 | 

N|      He bends over, picks it up, and looks at it.  Cradled in his

N|      hand, we canít see what it is.  But to him, itís very

N|      interesting.

N|      He steps up his pace, headed for the car.

N|      The sleek front power car, looking like the nose of an SST,

N|      gets its 25,000 volt charge from the overhead catenary.

N|      The rear power car gets its jolt.

N|      The TGV starts to move, pulling out of the station.

N|      The business car is similar to the one ETHAN saw on the first

N|      train they look across Europe.  Itís crowded, maybe THIRTY

N|      MEN and WOMEN in suits, most of them already immersed in work

N|      on their laptops or talking on their cellular phones.

N|      One such woman is MAX in her seat, number 27.  MATTHIAS and

N|      the OTHER MAN, last seen dropping off ETHAN in Prague, sit

D|                 My apologies Max.  Couldnít be helped.

D|                 Thereís a piece of black cloth under your

D|                 seat.  Tear it away and youíll find the

D|                 disk.

 | 

N|      MAX reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer

N|      disk as promised.  She hands it to Matthias who strips off

N|      the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the

N|      computer in the briefcase.  He boots it up quickly and turns

N|      the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to

N|      see.

 | 

N|      One half of the screen, with the heading "CRYPTONYM AND

N|      OPERATIONAL SPECS" is already jammed with information.  The

N|      blank second half of the screen acquires the title "TRUE

N|      NAME," and information starts filling itself in rapidly --

N|      names, addresses, identities.

 | 

N|      As the two sides match up, a legend flashes:

C|                           MAX

 | 

N|      LUTHER, three rows behind in another seat, is at work on a

N|      laptop of his own.  A mobile Nokia phone is beside it - red

N|      light flashing.

 | 

S|      INT. SECOND CLASS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE) - DAY

 | 

N|      KITTRIDGE and BARNES move through the second class car.  They

N|      turn around and start working their way back again.

 | 

N|      At the front, CLAIRE is getting desperate.  A LARGE MAN

N|      passes through the door behind her.

 | 

N|      The LARGE MAN continues back, nearing KITTRIDGE and BARNES,

N|      who are forced to step into empty seats on the side in order

N|      to make room for him to pass.  As they move by him, their

N|      vision is momentarily blocked --

 | 

N|      -- and CLAIRE gets up to follow.

 | 

N|      She follows to the rear of the car and she passes through the

N|      door and out of the car, after KITTRIDGE and BARNES talk in

N|      doorway.

 | 

C|                           BARNES

D|                 Only four more cars.

C|                           KITTRIDGE

D|                 And if we donít find him - weíll search

D|                 the whole train again.

C|                           BARNES

D|                 Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE

D|                 High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No-

D|                 one gets off.  High security.  Good place

D|                 for a pass off to Max.

C|                           BARNES

D|                 But why tell us?

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE

D|                 Heís putting on a show, Barnes.

 | 

C|                           BARNES

D|                 What kind of show.

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE

D|                 I donít know.

M|                      (looks at his wrist monitor)

D|                 It didnít say on the tickets.

 | 

N|      KITTRIDGE and BARNES go off back through the next coach.

N|      CLAIRE follows into the same doorway and stops to speak into

N|      her wristwatch to ETHAN:

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE

D|                 Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How

D|                 far is he from Luther?

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE

D|                 Two cars.  Where are you?

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 You are my eyes.  Stay with him.

N|      message flashes.

D|                 Iíll be there.

 | 

N|      MAX hangs up and hands the phone to MATTHIAS who slots it

N|      into the briefcase next to the computer.  He dials a number

N|      on the keyboard and pushes send.  The computer emits a DIAL

N|      TONE.  Her computer flashes a message.

M|                   (Pause as he tries the phone)

D|                 Well is something wrong with the

D|                 batteries?

C|                           MATTHIAS

D|                 I always check the batteries.

D|                 This is bullshit - we donít even know

D|                 what Max looks like.

 | 

C|                           BARNES

D|                 Maybe we donít have to know what he looks

D|                 like.  If heís got that list, heís going

D|                 to want to check it.  We should be

D|                 looking for laptops.

C|                           KITTRIDGE

D|                 Good idea.

S|      INT. BUSINESS CAR - (LUTHER) - MOVING - DAY

 | 

N|      LUTHER sees them coming.  He smacks the laptop shut and

N|      positions his jamming phone on the table to point at Maxís

N|      computer.  He gets up, taking his computer with him, headed

N|      for the rear of the car.  A WAITER sees the phone and goes

N|      after LUTHER with it.

C|                           WAITER

D|                 Excuse me, Sir, your telephone...

N|      OTHER PASSENGERSí phones nearby go haywire.  LUTHER looks to

N|      MAX.  Exits car.

 | 

S|      INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - (MAX) - DAY

 | 

N|      Her dial tone finally hits the static of a computer

N|      connection and the message on her screen changes:

S|      INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY

 | 

N|      LUTHER shuts himself in the bathroom.  The OTHER MAN follows

N|      him, tries the door and waits his moment.  The OTHER MAN

N|      bangs against the door.  LUTHER braces himself against the

N|      door.

S|      INT. ANOTHER CAR - MOVING - DAY

N|      CLAIRE walking through.  She pauses to listen in her

N|      KITTRIDGE and BARNES are looking at the people in the

N|      Business Car behind MAX.  CLAIRE passes them by heading for

N|      the last executive coach to get to Club and Baggage Car.  She

N|      passes the OTHER MAN at the bathroom door.  He follows her.

C|                           KITTRIDGE

N|      KITTRIDGE and BARNES have seen CLAIRE go through MAXíS

N|      Business Car and past the OTHER MAN at the bathroom door.

N|      there to listen.

N|      CLAIRE moves swiftly through the last car (after MAXíS car).

N|      up into the Club Car and opens the door leading to the

N|      BAGGAGE CAR.  Goes in.  The door slams shut.

D|                 Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him?

D|                 We take the money.  Ethan takes the

D|                 You knew about Jim?

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew

D|                 is something of a question.  Before or

D|                 after I showed in London, mind telling

D|                 me, Ethan?

 | 

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Before London.  But after you took the

D|                 Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk?

D|                 Well, Claire, youíve asked the question

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 I knew about Jim.

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 But, he didnít know about you.  In all

D|                 fairness, Ethan, Claire was never

D|                 convinced her charms would work with you.

D|                 But I was supremely confident - having

D|                 tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet

D|                 thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan

D|                 is in love with you, Claire, make no

D|                 mistake about it.  And like all the 

D|                 worldís lovers, heís tortured by the

D|                 same, one pathetic question - "does she

D|                 feel the same way I do?"

 | 

N|      JIM turns to CLAIRE.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 Well Claire do you?  Have you been

D|                 exploiting his feelings or returning

D|                 them?

C|                           CLAIRE

D|                 Jim - lets just get the money and get out

D|                 of here.

N|      CLAIRE goes to ETHAN.

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 Keep counting Claire.

C|                           CLAIRE

D|                 It was me.  I did it.

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not

D|                 the only one whoís seen you alive.

N|      ETHAN throws JIM the Visco glasses.

 | 

C|                           KITTRIDGE

D|                 Good morning, Mr Phelps.

 | 

N|      PHELPS and CLAIRE are stunned.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 You son of a bitch.

 | 

N|      PHELPS points the gun at ETHAN.

C|                           CLAIRE

D|                 Donít Jim.

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You

D|                 like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE

D|                 Yes.

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Jim, itís over.

 | 

C|                           PHELPS

D|                 Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing

D|                 can be more dangerous than the truth.  It

D|                 can kill you.

 | 

N|      PHELPS shoots CLAIRE.  Struggle between PHELPS and ETHAN.

N|      The gun is lost.  PHELPS beats ETHAN to the ground.  His

N|      watch alarm beeps rapidly.  He turns, goes up the stairs

N|      and...

 | 

N|      ETHAN goes to CLAIRE.

C|                           

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Claire...Hey...

 | 

C|                           CLAIRE

D|                 This stuff is so sticky.

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 Claire.

C|                           CLAIRE

D|                 Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me

D|                 back...wonít you...

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 I always have, Claire.. 

 | 

N|      CLAIRE dies.  ETHAN looks to ladder hatch and climbs ladder. 

 | 

S|      INT. REAR CAR - ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY

 | 

N|      PHELPS climbs up a ladder past an inert engineer slumped over 

N|      the control panel -- an obvious earlier victim of PHELPS. 

N|      PHELPS puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door 

N|      and climbs through it -- 

 | 

S|      EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

 | 

N|      -- halfway out onto the roof of the train.  He reaches into 

N|      his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle 

N|      on the end of it.  He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof 

N|      and pulls himself the rest of the way out. 

 | 

N|      He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the 

N|      smooth surface of the train. 

 | 

N|      Now for the tough part.  Using the suction cups, PHELPS 

N|      slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and 

N|      replanting the cups as he goes.  

 | 

N|      He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the 

N|      back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, 

N|      a window for the ENGINEER. 

 | 

N|      Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his 

N|      belt.

 | 

N|      He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train.  From out 

N|      of the fog, a helicopter approaches. 

 | 

N|      PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is 

N|      going.  In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching 

N|      the tunnel under the English Channel.  His eyes widen. 

 | 

S|      INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

 | 

N|      KRIEGER is at the controls.  He sees the approaching tunnel 

N|      as well. 

 | 

S|      EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

 | 

N|      PHELPS crawls like hell to get into position.  Looking up, he 

N|      sees KRIEGER pointing frantically behind him. PHELPS turns. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN is climbing out the trap door. 

 | 

N|      A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost 

N|      touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. 

N|      Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to 

N|      grab small holes on the roof.  

 | 

N|      He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other 

N|      way.  Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof. 

 | 

S|      INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

 | 

N|      KRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching.  He gestures 

N|      to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing 

N|      over PHELPS and then back to him. 

 | 

S|      EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

 | 

N|      PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto 

N|      his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the 

N|      roof. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto 

N|      the roof. 

 | 

N|      PHELPS and ETHAN struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously 

N|      closer to the chunnel entrance. 

 | 

N|      They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance. 

 | 

S|      INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

 | 

N|      KRIEGER sees the tunnel, only seconds away now.  He paws at 

N|      the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever. 

 | 

S|      EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

 | 

N|      PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the 

N|      train.  PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the 

N|      strap manages to pull himself back on. 

 | 

N|      -- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel -- 

 | 

S|      -- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT! 

 | 

S|      INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY

 | 

N|      As the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes 

N|      nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes 

N|      one last time.  This time it says: 

 | 

 |                 CONNECTION TERMINATED. 

 |                     TRANSFER LOST.

 | 

N|      MAX'S face falls.

C|                           MAX

D|                 Damn!

 | 

S|      INT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY

 | 

N|      Another CONDUCTOR races into the power car, past his inert 

N|      companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the 

N|      train.  He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it. 

 | 

C|                           CONDUCTOR 

D|                 No, no, it's IN the tunnel! 

 | 

C|                           VOICE (O.S.) 

D|                 Stop the train! 

 | 

C|                           CONDUCTOR 

D|                 It'll crash into us!  Accelerate, 

D|                 accelerate. 

 | 

S|      EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY

 | 

N|      For a moment, we see no one.  No ETHAN.  No PHELPS.  Moving 

N|      around to the other end of the car, we see where they've 

N|      gone. 

 | 

N|      They're dangling from either side of it. 

 | 

N|      PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself 

N|      back onto the roof of the train.  ETHAN reaches for the other 

N|      cup. 

 | 

N|      The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track 

N|      and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER 

N|      pushing it up to full speed again. 

 | 

N|      But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the 

N|      train. 

 | 

S|      EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY

 | 

N|      PHELPS, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the 

N|      windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of 

N|      KRIEGER'S copter. 

 | 

N|      He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the 

N|      other direction. 

 | 

N|      Another train. 

 | 

N|      At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the 

N|      oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the 

N|      roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as 

N|      it blows by. 

 | 

N|      The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS 

N|      misses the skid.  

 | 

N|      KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate 

N|      ETHAN with the rotor.  PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the 

N|      copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the 

N|      tunnel.  SPARKS and chunks of cement fly.  

 | 

N|      KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly.  ETHAN uses the moment to 

N|      leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid. 

 | 

N|      PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another. 

N|      Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls 

N|      out -- 

 | 

N|      -- a red and green piece of bubble gum. 

 | 

N|      PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles 

N|      frantically for his gun. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Red light, green light.  Asta Lasagna 

D|                 mother fucker. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the 

N|      copter's underbelly and turns away from it. 

 | 

N|      PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum, SCREAMING -- 

 | 

N|      -- but the gum EXPLODES.  The force of the blast rockets 

N|      ETHAN forward, he lands on the train's windshield. 

 | 

N|      The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers 

N|      wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under 

N|      the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball. 

 | 

N|      ETHAN, stuck on the windshield, can only watch as the 

N|      wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him. 

N|      It stops just short of him, with its bent and broken rotor 

N|      blade barely missing his throat.  

 | 

N|      ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly 

N|      drained.

S|      INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY

N|      KITTRIDGE comes back into the business car and is joined by 

N|      BARNES.  LUTHER, only slightly bruised, stands up next to 

N|      them and gestures to MAX and her laptop. 

 | 

C|                           LUTHER

D|                 I think this is what you're looking for. 

 | 

N|      MAX looks up, stunned.  KITTRIDGE leans over and peers at her 

N|      screen. He just smiles and sits down next to her, content to 

N|      wait for her to speak. 

 | 

N|      When she finally does, she's almost charming.

N|      KITTRIDGE leans closer to her and lowers his voice, just as 

N|      friendly.

C|                           KITTRIDGE 

D|                 Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of

N|      LUTHER sits on a high stool, his PowerBook next to him, while 

N|      he sips a beer.  A television screen is featuring follow-up 

N|      coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in 

N|      the chunnel.  Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of 

N|      a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in 

N|      the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was 

N|      there were no other fatalaties.  There are intermittent 

N|      sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of 

N|      arrivals and departures.  ETHAN into shot.  He sits beside 

S|      LUTHER.

C|                           ETHAN

D|                 You're more than that, Luther.  They were 

D|                 mistaken about you and they're trying to 

D|                 show you they know it.  They want you 

D|                 back in. 

 | 

C|                           LUTHER

D|                 Sure.  They want me back in so I won't 

D|                 break in!  They still can't figure out 

D|                 how we did it.

C|                           ETHAN

C|                           LUTHER 

D|                 I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back 

D|                 pay, give me a promotion, check out my 

D|                 office at Langley and then, maybe, talk 

D|                 about it.

C|                           ETHAN 

M|                      (laughing)

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Just don't know why I'd be doing it.

C|                           LUTHER 

D|                 Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss 

D|                 being disreputable. 

 | 

C|                           ETHAN 

D|                 Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any 

D|                 better I'll always think of you that way. 

 | 

N|      The two men understand one another and LUTHER will say no 

N|      more.  The two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a 

N|      moment ETHAN disappears from the bar, leaving a contemplative 

N|      LUTHER looking after him.
